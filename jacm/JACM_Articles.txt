Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the \""unintelligibility\"" condition in obfuscation as meaning that O(P) is a \""virtual black box,\"" in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given O(P), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to P. In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of efficient programs P that are unobfuscatable in the sense that (a) given any efficient program P' that computes the same function as a program P is an element of P, the \"" source code\"" P can be efficiently reconstructed, yet (b) given oracle access to a (randomly selected) program P is an element of P, no efficient algorithm can reconstruct P (or even distinguish a certain bit in the code from random) except with negligible probability. We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (TC0). We also rule out several potential applications of obfuscators, by constructing \""unobfuscatable\"" signature schemes, encryption schemes, and pseudorandom function families."""

With large, streaming data sets, this problem becomes particularly difficult when the data is shared across multiple distributed sites. The main challenge is to ensure that a sample is drawn uniformly across the union of the data while minimizing the communication needed to run the protocol on the evolving data. At the same time, it is also necessary to make the protocol lightweight, by keeping the space and time costs low for each participant. In this article, we present communication-efficient protocols for continuously maintaining a sample (both with and without replacement) from k distributed streams. These apply to the case when we want a sample from the full streams, and to the sliding window cases of only the W most recent elements, or arrivals within the last w time units.

Focusing on goals provides a framework for addressing the problem of potential \misunderstanding\"" during communication, where the misunderstanding arises from lack of initial agreement on what protocol and/or language is being used in communication. In this context, \""reliable communication\"" means overcoming any initial misunderstanding between parties towards achieving a given goal. Despite the enormous diversity among the goals of communication, we propose a simple model that captures all goals. In the simplest form of communication we consider, two parties, a user and a server, attempt to communicate with each other in order to achieve some goal of the user. We show that any goal of communication can be modeled mathematically by introducing a third party, which we call the referee, who hypothetically monitors the conversation between the user and the server and determines whether or not the goal has been achieved. Potential misunderstanding between the players is captured by allowing each player (the user/server) to come from a (potentially infinite) class of players such that each player is unaware which instantiation of the other it is talking to. We identify a main concept, which we call sensing, that allows goals to be achieved even under misunderstanding. Informally, sensing captures the user's ability (potentially using help from the server) to simulate the referee's assessment on whether the communication is achieving the goal. We show that when the user can sense progress, the goal of communication can be achieved despite initial misunderstanding. We also show that in certain settings sensing is necessary for overcoming such initial misunderstanding. Our results significantly extend the scope of the investigation started by Juba and Sudan (STOC 2008) who studied the foregoing phenomenon in the case of a single specific goal. Our study shows that their main suggestion, that misunderstanding can be detected and possibly corrected by focusing on the goal, can be proved in full generality."""

The importance of rationality is that it opens up the possibility of computing an optimal solution to the program via an algorithm that is either combinatorial or uses an LP-oracle. Next, we define a new Nash bargaining game, called ADNB, which is derived from the linear case of the Arrow-Debreu market model. We show that the convex program for ADNB is a logarithmic RCP, but unlike other known members of this class, it is nontotal. Our main result is a combinatorial, polynomial-time algorithm for ADNB. It turns out that the reason for infeasibility of logarithmic RCPs is quite different from that for LPs and quadratic RCPs. We believe that our ideas for surmounting the new difficulties will be useful for dealing with other nontotal RCPs as well. We give an application of our combinatorial algorithm for ADNB to an important \fair\"" throughput allocation problem on a wireless channel.

This result avoids a well-known lower bound by having step complexity that is polylogarithmic in the number of values the object can take or the number of operations applied to it. The key step in these implementations is amethod for constructing a max register, a linearizable, wait-free concurrent data structure that supports a write operation and a read operation that returns the largest value previously written. For fixed m, an m-valued max register is constructed from one-bit multi-writer multireader registers at a cost of at most [log m] atomic register operations per write or read. An unbounded max register is constructed with cost O(min(log v, n)) to read or write a value v. Max registers are used to transform any monotone circuit into a wait-free concurrent data structure that provides write operations setting the inputs to the circuit and a read operation that returns the value of the circuit on the largest input values previously supplied. One application is a simple, linearizable, waitfree counter with a cost of O(min(log nlog v, n)) to perform an increment and O(min(log v, n)) to perform a read, where v is the current value of the counter. For polynomially-many increments, this becomes O(log(2) n), an exponential improvement on the best previously known upper bounds of O(n) for exact counting and O(n(4/5+epsilon)) for approximate counting. Finally, it is shown that the upper bounds are almost optimal. It is shown that for deterministic implementations, even if they are only required to satisfy solo-termination, min([log m], n - 1) is a lower bound on the worst-case complexity for an m-valued bounded max register, which is exactly equal to the upper bound for m <= 2(n-1), and min(n-1, [log m] - log ([log m] + k)) is a lower bound for the read operation of an m-valued k-additive-accurate counter, which is a bounded counter in which a read operation is allowed to return a value within an additive error of +/- k of the number of increment operations linearized before it. Furthermore, even in a solo-terminating randomized implementation of an n-valued max register with an oblivious adversary and global coins, there exist simple schedules in which, with high probability, the worst-case step complexity of a read operation is Omega (log n/log log n) if the write operations have polylogarithmic step complexity."

In this paper, we study a series of fundamental properties of probabilistic omega-automata with three different language-semantics: (1) the probable semantics that requires positive acceptance probability, (2) the almost-sure semantics that requires acceptance with probability 1, and (3) the threshold semantics that relies on an additional parameter lambda is an element of] 0, 1[that specifies a lower probability bound for the acceptance probability.

To rule out trivial solutions, a protocol must be anonymous: the value chosen by a process can depend on its input name and on the execution, but not on the specific process ID. Attiya et al. [1990] showed that renaming has a wait-free solution when K >= 2n. Several algebraic topology proofs of a lower bound stating that no such protocol exists when K < 2n have been published. In a companion article, we present the first completely combinatorial renaming lower bound proof stating if n + 1 is a primer power, then renaming is not wait-free solvable when K < 2n. In this article, we show that if n + 1 is not a primer power, then there exists a wait-free renaming protocol for K = 2n - 1. Therefore the renaming lower bound for K < 2n is incorrect. More precisely, our main theorem states that there exists a wait-free renaming protocol for K < 2n if and only if n + 1 is not a prime power. We prove this result using the known equivalence of K-renaming for K = 2n - 1 and the weak symmetry breaking task: processes have no input values and the output values are 0 or 1, and it is required that in every execution in which all processes participate, at least one process decides 1 and at least one process decides 0."

Shape analysis is a form of program analysis that attempts to infer descriptions of the data structures in a program, and to prove that these structures are not misused or corrupted. It is one of the more challenging and expensive forms of program analysis, due to the complexity of aliasing and the need to look arbitrarily deeply into the program heap. This article describes a method of boosting shape analyses by defining a compositional method, where each procedure is analyzed independently of its callers. The analysis algorithm uses a restricted fragment of separation logic, and assigns a collection of Hoare triples to each procedure; the triples provide an over-approximation of data structure usage. Our method brings the usual benefits of compositionality-increased potential to scale, ability to deal with incomplete programs, graceful way to deal with imprecision-to shape analysis, for the first time. The analysis rests on a generalized form of abduction (inference of explanatory hypotheses), which we call bi-abduction. Bi-abduction displays abduction as a kind of inverse to the frame problem: it jointly infers anti-frames (missing portions of state) and frames (portions of state not touched by an operation), and is the basis of a new analysis algorithm. We have implemented our analysis and we report case studies on smaller programs to evaluate the quality of discovered specifications, and larger code bases (e.g., sendmail, an imap server, a Linux distribution) to illustrate the level of automation and scalability that we obtain from our compositional method.

One desirable property is fairness which guarantees, informally, that if one party receives its output, then the other party does too. Cleve [1986] showed that complete fairness cannot be achieved in general without an honest majority. Since then, the accepted folklore has been that nothing non-trivial can be computed with complete fairness in the two-party setting. We demonstrate that this folklore belief is false by showing completely fair protocols for various nontrivial functions in the two-party setting based on standard cryptographic assumptions. We first show feasibility of obtaining complete fairness when computing any function over polynomial-size domains that does not contain an \embedded XOR\""; this class of functions includes boolean AND/OR as well as Yao's \""millionaires' problem\"". We also demonstrate feasibility for certain functions that do contain an embedded XOR, though we prove a lower bound showing that any completely fair protocol for such functions must have round complexity super-logarithmic in the security parameter. Our results demonstrate that the question of completely fair secure computation without an honest majority is far from closed."""	"[Gordon, S.

A series of results have provided algorithms to efficiently construct structures whose existence is non-constructively guaranteed by the LLL, culminating in the recent breakthrough of Moser and Tardos [2010] for the full asymmetric LLL. We show that the output distribution of the Moser-Tardos algorithm well-approximates the conditional LLL-distribution, the distribution obtained by conditioning on all bad events being avoided. We show how a known bound on the probabilities of events in this distribution can be used for further probabilistic analysis and give new constructive and nonconstructive results. We also show that when a LLL application provides a small amount of slack, the number of resamplings of the Moser-Tardos algorithm is nearly linear in the number of underlying independent variables (not events!), and can thus be used to give efficient constructions in cases where the underlying proof applies the LLL to super-polynomially many events. Even in cases where finding a bad event that holds is computationally hard, we show that applying the algorithm to avoid a polynomial-sized \""core\"" subset of bad events leads to a desired outcome with high probability. This is shown via a simple union bound over the probabilities of non-core events in the conditional LLL-distribution, and automatically leads to simple and efficient Monte-Carlo (and in most cases RNC) algorithms. We demonstrate this idea on several applications. We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the Santa Claus problem by making a LLL-based proof of Feige constructive. We provide Monte Carlo algorithms for acyclic edge coloring, nonrepetitive graph colorings, and Ramsey-type graphs. In all these applications, the algorithm falls directly out of the non-constructive LLL-based proof. Our algorithms are very simple, often provide better bounds than previous algorithms, and are in several cases the first efficient algorithms known. As a second type of application we show that the properties of the conditional LLL-distribution can be used in cases beyond the critical dependency threshold of the LLL: avoiding all bad events is impossible in these cases. As the first (even nonconstructive) result of this kind, we show that by sampling a selected smaller core from the LLL-distribution, we can avoid a fraction of bad events that is higher than the expectation. MAX h-SAT is an illustrative example of this."""

This characterization is proved through the use of a parallelized form of the matrix multiplicative weights update method, applied to a class of semidefinite programs that captures the computational power of quantum interactive proof systems. One striking implication of this characterization is that quantum computing provides no increase in computational power whatsoever over classical computing in the context of interactive proof systems, for it is well known that the collection of computational problems having classical interactive proof systems coincides with those problems solvable by polynomial-space computations."

We show that for packing domains, any alpha-approximation algorithm that also bounds the integrality gap of the LP relaxation of the problem by alpha can be used to construct an alpha-approximation mechanism that is truthful in expectation. This immediately yields a variety of new and significantly improved results for various problem domains and furthermore, yields truthful (in expectation) mechanisms with guarantees that match the best-known approximation guarantees when truthfulness is not required. In particular, we obtain the first truthful mechanisms with approximation guarantees for a variety of multiparameter domains. We obtain truthful (in expectation) mechanisms achieving approximation guarantees of O(root m) for combinatorial auctions (CAs), (1 + epsilon) for multiunit CAs with B = Omega (logm) copies of each item, and 2 for multiparameter knapsack problems (multi-unit auctions). Our construction is based on considering an LP relaxation of the problem and using the classic VCG mechanism to obtain a truthful mechanism in this fractional domain. We argue that the (fractional) optimal solution scaled down by alpha, where alpha is the integrality gap of the problem, can be represented as a convex combination of integer solutions, and by viewing this convex combination as specifying a probability distribution over integer solutions, we get a randomized, truthful in expectation mechanism.

In order to close the gap between practical performance and theoretical analysis, the k-means method has been studied in the model of smoothed analysis. But even the smoothed analyses so far are unsatisfactory as the bounds are still super-polynomial in the number n of data points. In this article, we settle the smoothed running time of the k-means method. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is bounded by a polynomial in n and 1/sigma, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations.

The processors are allowed to communicate only with their neighbors in G. The communication is synchronous, that is, it proceeds in discrete rounds. In the distributed vertex coloring problem, the objective is to color G with Delta + 1, or slightly more than Delta + 1, colors using as few rounds of communication as possible. (The number of rounds of communication will be henceforth referred to as running time.) Efficient randomized algorithms for this problem are known for more than twenty years [Alon et al. 1986; Luby 1986]. Specifically, these algorithms produce a (Delta + 1)-coloring within O(log n) time, with high probability. On the other hand, the best known deterministic algorithm that requires polylogarithmic time employs O(Delta(2)) colors. This algorithm was devised in a seminal FOCS'87 paper by Linial [1987]. Its running time is O(log*n). In the same article, Linial asked whether one can color with significantly less than Delta(2) colors in deterministic polylogarithmic time. By now, this question of Linial became one of the most central long-standing open questions in this area. In this article, we answer this question in the affirmative, and devise a deterministic algorithm that employs Delta(1 to (1))(1) colors, and runs in polylogarithmic time. Specifically, the running time of our algorithm is O(f (Delta) log Delta logn), for an arbitrarily slow-growing function f (Delta) = omega(1). We can also produce an O(Delta(1+n))-coloring in O(log Delta logn)-time, for an arbitrarily small constant eta > 0, and an O(Delta)-coloring in O(Delta(epsilon) logn) time, for an arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0. Our results are, in fact, far more general than this. In particular, for a graph of arboricity a, our algorithm produces an O(a(1+eta))-coloring, for an arbitrarily small constant eta > 0, in time O(log alpha log n)."

As a first step, we show how to build a Steiner forest spanner for such graphs. The crux of the process is a clustering procedure called prize-collecting clustering that breaks down the input instance into separate subinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different subinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively inexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can be solved (almost) separately. Another building block is a PTAS for Steiner forest on graphs of bounded treewidth. Surprisingly, Steiner forest is NP-hard even on graphs of treewidth 3. Therefore, our PTAS for bounded-treewidth graphs needs a nontrivial combination of approximation arguments and dynamic programming on the tree decomposition. We further show that Steiner forest can be solved in polynomial time for series-parallel graphs (graphs of treewidth at most two) by a novel combination of dynamic programming and minimum cut computations, completing our thorough complexity study of Steiner forest in the range of bounded-treewidth graphs, planar graphs, and bounded-genus graphs."

Closing this big approximability gap is a well-known and long-standing open problem. This article closes many gaps in our understanding of the hardness of this problem and answers several open questions in the literature. It is shown the first nonconstant inapproximability result that almost matches the best-known approximation algorithm for acyclic job shops. The same bounds hold for the general version of flow shops, where jobs are not required to be processed on each machine.

This requires rethinking the very basic concepts of traditional data exchange, such as solution, universal solution, and the certain answers of target queries. We develop a framework for data exchange over probabilistic databases, and make a case for its coherence and robustness. This framework applies to arbitrary schema mappings, and finite or countably infinite probability spaces on the source and target instances. After establishing this framework and formulating the key concepts, we study the application of the framework to a concrete and practical setting where probabilistic databases are compactly encoded by means of annotations formulated over random Boolean variables. In this setting, we study the problems of testing for the existence of solutions and universal solutions, materializing such solutions, and evaluating target queries (for unions of conjunctive queries) in both the exact sense and the approximate sense. For each of the problems, we carry out a complexity analysis based on properties of the annotation, for various classes of dependencies. Finally, we show that the framework and results easily and completely generalize to allow not only the data, but also the schema mapping itself to be probabilistic."

The objective in the streaming model is to use small amount of memory (preferably sub-linear in the number of nodes n) and a smaller number of passes. In the streaming model, we show how to perform several graph computations including estimating the probability distribution after a random walk of length l, the mixing time M, and other related quantities such as the conductance of the graph. By applying our algorithm for computing probability distribution on the web-graph, we can estimate the PageRank p of any node up to an additive error of root epsilon p+ epsilon in (O) over tilde(root M/alpha) passes and (O) over tilde (min(n alpha + 1/epsilon root M/alpha + (1/epsilon)M alpha, alpha n root M alpha + (1/epsilon)root M/alpha)) space, for any alpha is an element of (0, 1]. Specifically, for epsilon = M/n, alpha = M(-1/2), we can compute the approximate PageRank values in (O) over tilde (nM(-1/4)) space and (O) over tilde (M(3/4)) passes. In comparison, a standard implementation of the PageRank algorithm will take O(n) space and O(M) passes.

Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the l(1) norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces."

For each x is an element of V, let c(x) be the cost of reading the value of x. An algorithm for evaluating f is a strategy for adaptively identifying and reading a set of variables U subset of V whose values uniquely determine the value of f. We are interested in finding algorithms which minimize the cost incurred to evaluate f in the above sense. Competitive analysis is employed to measure the performance of the algorithms. We address two variants of the above problem. We consider the basic model in which the evaluation algorithm knows the cost c(x), for each x is an element of V. We also study a novel model where the costs of the variables are not known in advance and some preemption is allowed in the reading operations. This model has applications, for example, when reading a variable coincides with obtaining the output of a job on a CPU and the cost is the CPU time. For the model where the costs of the variables are known, we present a polynomial time algorithm with the best possible competitive ratio gamma(f)(c) for each function f that is representable by a threshold tree and for each fixed cost function c(.). Remarkably, the best-known result for the same class of functions is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm with competitiveness 2 gamma(f)(c). Still in the same model, we introduce the Linear Programming Approach (LPA), a framework that allows the design of efficient algorithms for evaluating functions. We show that different implementations of this approach lead in general to the best algorithms known so far-and in many cases to optimal algorithms-for different classes of functions considered before in the literature. Via the LPA, we are able to determine exactly the optimal extremal competitiveness of monotone Boolean functions. Remarkably, the upper bound which leads to this result, holds for a much broader class of functions, which also includes the whole set of Boolean functions. We also show how to extend the LPA (together with these results) to the model where the costs of the variables are not known beforehand. In particular, we show how to employ the extended LPA to design a polynomial-time optimal (with respect to competitiveness) algorithm for the class of monotone Boolean functions representable by threshold trees."

In static settings, it is well known that atomic R/W storage can be implemented in a fault-tolerant manner even if the system is completely asynchronous, whereas consensus is not solvable. In contrast, all existing emulations of atomic storage in dynamic systems rely on consensus or stronger primitives, leading to a popular belief that dynamic R/W storage is unattainable without consensus. In this article, we specify the problem of dynamic atomic read/write storage in terms of the interface available to the users of such storage.

Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/M Sigma(M)(i=1) z(i)(T) A(zi), where the z(i) are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the z(i)s, all of which lead to E (1/M Sigma(M)(i=1)z(i)(T)Az(i)) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of Abut rather an efficient method compute z(T) Az given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-delta, the relative error in the estimate is at most epsilon. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best. We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators."

In its ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard to approximate to any nontrivial factor, and little progress has been made on this problem despite its significance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty. In this article, we consider the FEEDBACK MAB problem, where the reward obtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an underlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the arm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to maximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is also an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and is widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the FEEDBACK MAB problem does not admit to greedy index-based optimal policies. We develop a novel duality-based algorithmic technique that yields a surprisingly simple and intuitive (2 + epsilon)-approximate greedy policy to this problem. We show that both in terms of approximation factor and computational efficiency, our policy is closely related to the Whittle index, which is widely used for its simplicity and efficiency of computation. Subsequently we define a multi-state generalization, that we term MONOTONE bandits, which remains subclass of the restless bandit problem. We show that our policy remains a 2-approximation in this setting, and further, our technique is robust enough to incorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays, switching costs, and even models where determining the state of an arm is a separate operation from playing it. Our technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit problems, and we provide an example in nonpreemptive machine replenishment. Interestingly, in this case, our policy provides a constant factor guarantee, whereas the Whittle index is provably polynomially worse. By presenting the first O(1) approximations for nontrivial instances of restless bandits as well as of POMDPs, our work initiates the study of approximation algorithms in both these contexts."

Given information about the database, a description of sensitive data, and assumptions about users' prior knowledge, our goal is to determine if answering a past user's query could have led to a privacy breach. According to our definition, an audited property A is private, given the disclosure of property B, if no user can gain confidence in A by learning B, subject to prior knowledge constraints. Privacy is not violated if the disclosure of B causes a loss of confidence in A. The new notion of privacy is formalized using the well-known semantics for reasoning about knowledge, where logical properties correspond to sets of possible worlds (databases) that satisfy these properties. Database users are modeled as either possibilistic agents whose knowledge is a set of possible worlds, or as probabilistic agents whose knowledge is a probability distribution on possible worlds. We analyze the new privacy notion, show its relationship with the conventional approach, and derive criteria that allow the auditor to test privacy efficiently in some important cases. In particular, we prove characterization theorems for the possibilistic case, and study in depth the probabilistic case under the assumption that all database records are considered a-priori independent by the user, as well as under more relaxed (or absent) prior-knowledge assumptions. In the probabilistic case we show that for certain families of distributions there is no efficient algorithm to test whether an audited property A is private given the disclosure of a property B, assuming P not equal NP. Nevertheless, for many interesting families, such as the family of product distributions, we obtain algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in practice."

The notion of an inverse of a schema mapping is subtle, because a schema mapping may associate many target instances with each source instance, and many source instances with each target instance. In PODS 2006, Fagin defined a notion of the inverse of a schema mapping. This notion is tailored to the types of schema mappings that commonly arise in practice (those specified by \source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies\"", or s-t tgds). We resolve the key open problem of the complexity of deciding whether there is an inverse. We also explore a number of interesting questions, including: What is the structure of an inverse? When is the inverse unique? How many nonequivalent inverses can there be? When does an inverse have an inverse? How big must an inverse be? Surprisingly, these questions are all interrelated. We show that for schema mappings M specified by full s-t tgds (those with no existential quantifiers), if M has an inverse, then it has a polynomial-size inverse of a particularly nice form, and there is a polynomial-time algorithm for generating it. We introduce the notion of \""essential conjunctions\"" (or \""essential atoms\"" in the full case), and show that they play a crucial role in the study of inverses. We use them to give greatly simplified proofs of some known results about inverses. What emerges is a much deeper understanding about this fundamental and complex operator."""

What is more, most exponential speedups in quantum computation are obtained by solving instances of the HSP. A common feature of the resulting algorithms is the use of quantum coset states, which encode the hidden subgroup. An open question has been how hard it is to use these states to solve graph isomorphism. It was recently shown by Moore et al. [2005] that only an exponentially small amount of information is available from one, or a pair of coset states. A potential source of power to exploit are entangled quantum measurements that act jointly on many states at once. We show that entangled quantum measurements on at least Omega(n log n) coset states are necessary to get useful information for the case of graph isomorphism, matching an information theoretic upper bound. This may be viewed as a negative result because in general it seems hard to implement a given highly entangled measurement. Our main theorem is very general and also rules out using joint measurements on few coset states for some other groups, such as GL(n, F(p)(m)) and G(n) where G is finite and satisfies a suitable property."

In particular, our theorem improves many of the hardness of approximation results that are proved using the parallel repetition theorem. A partial list includes the following: (1) 3SAT cannot be efficiently approximated to within a factor of 7/8 + o(1), unless P = NP. This holds even under almost-linear reductions. Previously, the best known NP-hardness factor was 7/8 + epsilon for any constant epsilon > 0, under polynomial reductions (Hastad). (2) 3LIN cannot be efficiently approximated to within a factor of 1/2 + o(1), unless P = NP. This holds even under almost-linear reductions. Previously, the best known NP-hardness factor was 1 2 + e for any constant epsilon > 0, under polynomial reductions (H astad). (3) A PCP Theorem with amortized query complexity 1 + o(1) and amortized free bit complexity o(1). Previously, the best-known amortized query complexity and free bit complexity were 1+ epsilon and e, respectively, for any constant epsilon > 0 (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan). One of the new ideas that we use is a new technique for doing the composition step in the (classical) proof of the PCP Theorem, without increasing the number of queries to the proof. We formalize this as a composition of new objects that we call Locally Decode/Reject Codes (LDRC). The notion of LDRC was implicit in several previous works, and we make it explicit in this work. We believe that the formulation of LDRCs and their construction are of independent interest."

Many applications, however, require features of both DLs and rules. Developing a formalism that integrates DLs and rules would be a natural outcome of a large body of research in knowledge representation and reasoning of the last two decades; however, achieving this goal is very challenging and the approaches proposed thus far have not fully reached it. In this paper, we present a hybrid formalism of MKNF(+) knowledge bases, which integrates DLs and rules in a coherent semantic framework. Achieving seamless integration is nontrivial, since DLs use an open-world assumption, while the rules are based on a closed-world assumption. We overcome this discrepancy by basing the semantics of our formalism on the logic of minimal knowledge and negation as failure (MKNF) by Lifschitz. We present several algorithms for reasoning with MKNF(+) knowledge bases, each suitable to different kinds of rules, and establish tight complexity bounds."

We say that a distribution X on binary strings of length n is a delta-source if X assigns probability at most 2(-delta n) to any string of length n. For every delta > 0, we construct the following poly(n)-time computable functions: -2-source disperser: D : ({0, 1}(n))(2) -> {0, 1} such that for any two independent delta-sources X(1), X(2) we have that the support of D(X(1), X(2)) is {0, 1}. -Bipartite Ramsey graph: Let N = 2(n). A corollary is that the function D is a 2-coloring of the edges of K(N,N) (the complete bipartite graph over two sets of N vertices) such that any induced subgraph of size N(delta) by N(delta) is not monochromatic. -3-source extractor: E : ({0, 1}(n))(3) -> {0, 1} such that for any three independent delta-sources X(1), X(2), X(3) we have that E(X(1), X(2), X(3)) is o(1)-close to being an unbiased random bit. No previous explicit construction was known for either of these for any delta < 1/2, and these results constitute significant progress to long-standing open problems. A component in these results is a new construction of condensers that may be of independent interest: This is a function C : {0, 1}(n) -> ({0, 1}(n/c))(d) (where c and d are constants that depend only on delta) such that for every delta-source X one of the output blocks of C(X) is (exponentially close to) a 0.9-source. (This result was obtained independently by Ran Raz.) The constructions are quite involved and use as building blocks other new and known objects. A recurring theme in these constructions is that objects that were designed to work with independent inputs, sometimes perform well enough with correlated, high entropy inputs. The construction of the disperser is based on a new technique which we call \the challenge-response mechanism\"" that (in some sense) allows \""identifying high entropy regions\"" in a given pair of sources using only one sample from the two sources."""

The classical theorems of Bourgain, and of Johnson and Lindenstrauss say that any metric on n points embeds into an O( log n)-dimensional Euclidean space with O( log n) distortion. Moreover, a simple \volume\"" argument shows that this bound is nearly tight: a uniform metric on n points requires nearly logarithmic number of dimensions to embed with logarithmic distortion. It is natural to ask whether such a volume restriction is the only hurdle to low-dimensional embeddings. In other words, do doubling metrics, that do not have large uniform submetrics, and thus no volume hurdles to low dimensional embeddings, embed in low dimensional Euclidean spaces with small distortion? In this article, we give a positive answer to this question. We show how to embed any doubling metrics into O( log log n) dimensions with o(log n) distortion. This is the first embedding for doubling metrics into fewer than logarithmic number of dimensions, even allowing for logarithmic distortion. This result is one extreme point of our general trade-off between distortion and dimension: given an n-point metric (V, d) with doubling dimension dim(D), and any target dimension T in the range Omega(dim(D) log log n) <= T <= O(log n), we show that the metric embeds into Euclidean space R(T) with O(log n root dim(D) /T) distortion."""

In this article, we define the Routing Betweenness Centrality (RBC) measure that generalizes previously well known Betweenness measures such as the Shortest Path Betweenness, Flow Betweenness, and Traffic Load Centrality by considering network flows created by arbitrary loop-free routing strategies. We present algorithms for computing RBC of all the individual vertices in the network and algorithms for computing the RBC of a given group of vertices, where the RBC of a group of vertices represents their potential to collaboratively monitor and control data flows in the network. Two types of collaborations are considered: (i) conjunctive-the group is a sequences of vertices controlling traffic where all members of the sequence process the traffic in the order defined by the sequence and (ii) disjunctive-the group is a set of vertices controlling traffic where at least one member of the set processes the traffic. The algorithms presented in this paper also take into consideration different sampling rates of network monitors, accommodate arbitrary communication patterns between the vertices (traffic matrices), and can be applied to groups consisting of vertices and/or edges. For the cases of routing strategies that depend on both the source and the target of the message, we present algorithms with time complexity of O(n(2)m) where n is the number of vertices in the network and m is the number of edges in the routing tree (or the routing directed acyclic graph (DAG) for the cases of multi-path routing strategies). The time complexity can be reduced by an order of n if we assume that the routing decisions depend solely on the target of the messages.

As an example of what this observation yields, consider the Boolean Formula Evaluation problem (BFE), which is complete for NC1 and has the self-reducibility property. It follows from a lower bound of Impagliazzo, Paturi, and Saks, that BFE requires depth d TC(0) circuits of size n(1+epsilon d).

It has generated general-purpose and practically successful algorithms and the foundations are quite well understood and captured by theoretical frameworks such as the PAC-learning model and the Statistical Learning theory framework. However, for many contemporary practical problems such as classifying web pages or detecting spam, there is often additional information available in the form of unlabeled data, which is often much cheaper and more plentiful than labeled data. As a consequence, there has recently been substantial interest in semi-supervised learning-using unlabeled data together with labeled data-since any useful information that reduces the amount of labeled data needed can be a significant benefit. Several techniques have been developed for doing this, along with experimental results on a variety of different learning problems. Unfortunately, the standard learning frameworks for reasoning about supervised learning do not capture the key aspects and the assumptions underlying these semi-supervised learning methods. In this article, we describe an augmented version of the PAC model designed for semi-supervised learning, that can be used to reason about many of the different approaches taken over the past decade in the Machine Learning community. This model provides a unified framework for analyzing when and why unlabeled data can help, in which one can analyze both sample-complexity and algorithmic issues. The model can be viewed as an extension of the standard PAC model where, in addition to a concept class C, one also proposes a compatibility notion: a type of compatibility that one believes the target concept should have with the underlying distribution of data. Unlabeled data is then potentially helpful in this setting because it allows one to estimate compatibility over the space of hypotheses, and to reduce the size of the search space from the whole set of hypotheses C down to those that, according to one's assumptions, are a-priori reasonable with respect to the distribution. As we show, many of the assumptions underlying existing semi-supervised learning algorithms can be formulated in this framework. After proposing the model, we then analyze sample-complexity issues in this setting: that is, how much of each type of data one should expect to need in order to learn well, and what the key quantities are that these numbers depend on. We also consider the algorithmic question of how to efficiently optimize for natural classes and compatibility notions, and provide several algorithmic results including an improved bound for Co-Training with linear separators when the distribution satisfies independence given the label."

Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the geometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that every n-vertex graph of genus g and maximum degree D satisfies lambda(2)(G) = O((g+1)(3)D/n) . This recovers the O(D/n) bound of Spielman and Teng for planar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of O((g+1)poly(D)/n), but our proof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus able to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by proving that lambda(2)(G) = O(Dh(6)log h/n) whenever G is K(h)-minor free. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to recover O(root n)-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a fixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on lambda(2) for graphs that exclude small-depth minors in the sense of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find separators of sublinear size in a general class of geometric graphs. Moreover, while the standard \sweep\"" algorithm applied to the second eigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree, our approach produces a vector that works for arbitrary graphs. This yields an alternate proof of the well-known nonplanar separator theorem of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that states that every excluded-minor family of graphs has O(root n)-node balanced separators."""

First, we prove that lambda(s) (n) <= n . 2(1/t!)(n)(t) + O(alpha(n)(t-1)) for s >= 4 even, and lambda(s)(n) <= n . 2((1/t!)alpha(n)t) (log2 alpha(n) + O(a(n)t)) for s >= 3 odd, where t = left perpendicular(s - 2)/2right perpendicular, and alpha(n) denotes the inverse Ackermann function. The previous upper bounds, by Agarwal et al. [1989], had a leading coefficient of 1 instead of 1/t! in the exponent. The bounds for even s are now tight up to lower-order terms in the exponent. These new bounds result from a small improvement on the technique of Agarwal et al. More importantly, we also present a new technique for deriving upper bounds for lambda(s) (n). This new technique is very similar to the one we applied to the problem of stabbing interval chains [Alon et al. 2008]. With this new technique we: (1) re-derive the upper bound of lambda(3)(n) = 2n alpha(n) + O(n root alpha(n)) (first shown by Klazar [1999]); (2) re-derive our own new upper bounds for general s; and (3) obtain improved upper bounds for the generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences considered by Adamec et al. [1992]. Regarding lower bounds, we show that lambda(3)(n) >= 2n alpha(n)-O(n) (the previous lower bound (Sharir and Agarwal, 1995) had a coefficient of 1 2), so the coefficient 2 is tight. We also present a simpler variant of the construction of Agarwal et al. [1989] that achieves the known lower bounds of lambda(s) (n) = n . 2((1/tl)alpha(n)t) - (O(alpha(n)t-1)) for s >= 4 even."

This article proposes a new data structure for indexing protein 3-D structures. For strings, there are many efficient indexing structures such as suffix trees, but it has been considered very difficult to design such sophisticated data structures against 3-D structures like proteins. Our index structure is based on the suffix tree and is called the geometric suffix tree. By using the geometric suffix tree for a set of protein structures, we can exactly search for all of their substructures whose RMSDs (root mean square deviations) or URMSDs (unit-vector root mean square deviations) to a given query 3-D structure are not larger than a given bound. Though there are O(N(2)) substructures in a structure of size N, our data structure requires only O(N) space for indexing all the substructures. We propose an O(N(2)) construction algorithm for it, while a naive algorithm would require O(N(3)) time to construct it. Moreover we propose an efficient search algorithm. Experiments show that we can search for similar structures much faster than previous algorithms if the RMSD threshold is not larger than 1 angstrom. The experiments also show that the construction time of the geometric suffix tree is practically almost linear to the size of the database, when applied to a protein structure database."

Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree.

More importantly, the worst-case clock skew between neighboring nodes is (asymptotically) at most a factor of two larger than the best possible bound. While previous results solely focused on the dependency of the skew bounds on the network diameter, we prove that our techniques are optimal also with respect to the maximum clock drift, the uncertainty in message delays, and the imposed bounds on the clock rates. The presented results all hold in a general model where both the clock drifts and the message delays may vary arbitrarily within pre-specified bounds. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits a number of other highly desirable properties. First, the algorithm ensures that the clock values remain in an affine linear envelope of real time. A better worst-case bound on the accuracy with respect to real time cannot be achieved in the absence of an external timer. Second, the algorithm minimizes the number and size of messages that need to be exchanged in a given time period. Moreover, only a small number of bits must be stored locally for each neighbor. Finally, our algorithm can easily be adapted for a variety of other prominent synchronization models."

In approximate nearest neighbor searching, a parameter epsilon > 0 is given, and a multiplicative error of (1 + epsilon) is allowed. We assume that the dimension d is a constant and treat n and epsilon as asymptotic quantities. Numerous solutions have been proposed, ranging from low-space solutions having space O(n) and query time O(log n+1/epsilon(d-1)) to high-space solutions having space roughly O((n log n)/epsilon(d)) and query time O(log(n/epsilon)). We show that there is a single approach to this fundamental problem, which both improves upon existing results and spans the spectrum of space-time tradeoffs. Given a tradeoff parameter gamma, where 2 <= gamma <= 1/epsilon, we show that there exists a data structure of space O(n gamma(d-1) log(1/epsilon)) that can answer queries in time O(log(n gamma) + 1/(epsilon gamma)((d-1)/2)). When gamma = 2, this yields a data structure of space O(n log(1/epsilon)) that can answer queries in time O(log n + 1/epsilon((d-1)/2)). When gamma = 1/epsilon, it provides a data structure of space O((n/epsilon(d-1)) log(1/epsilon)) that can answer queries in time O(log(n/epsilon)). Our results are based on a data structure called a (t, epsilon)-AVD, which is a hierarchical quadtree-based subdivision of space into cells. Each cell stores up to t representative points of the set, such that for any query point q in the cell at least one of these points is an approximate nearest neighbor of q. We provide new algorithms for constructing AVDs and tools for analyzing their total space requirements. We also establish lower bounds on the space complexity of AVDs, and show that, up to a factor of O(log(1/epsilon)), our space bounds are asymptotically tight in the two extremes, gamma = 2 and gamma = 1/epsilon."

As an immediate corollary, we obtain that the combinatorial complexity of the union of n cubes in R(3), having arbitrary side lengths, is O(n(2+epsilon)), for any epsilon > 0 (again, significantly extending the result of Pach et al.

Tree T may be of arbitrary degree and shape. Our goal is designing a compressed storage scheme of T that supports basic navigational operations among the immediate neighbors of a node (i.e. parent, ith child, or any child with some label, ...) as well as more sophisticated path-based search operations over its labeled structure. We present a novel approach to this problem by designing what we call the XBW-transform of the tree in the spirit of the well-knownBurrows-Wheeler transform for strings [1994]. The XBW-transform uses path-sorting to linearize the labeled tree T into two coordinated arrays, one capturing the structure and the other the labels. For the first time, by using the properties of the XBW-transform, our compressed indexes go beyond the information-theoretic lower bound, and support navigational and path-search operations over labeled trees within (near-) optimal time bounds and entropy-bounded space. Our XBW-transform is simple and likely to spur new results in the theory of tree compression and indexing, as well as interesting application contexts. As an example, we use the XBW-transform to design and implement a compressed index for XML documents whose compression ratio is significantly better than the one achievable by state-of-the-art tools, and its query time performance is order of magnitudes faster."

It is well known how to design secure protocols for achieving these goals when parties share high-entropy cryptographic keys in advance of the authentication stage. Unfortunately, it is much more common for users to share weak, low-entropy passwords which furthermore may be chosen from a known space of possibilities (say, a dictionary of English words). In this case, the problem becomes much more difficult as one must ensure that protocols are immune to off-line dictionary attacks in which an adversary exhaustively enumerates all possible passwords in an attempt to determine the correct one. We propose a 3-round protocol for password-only authenticated key exchange, and provide a rigorous proof of security for our protocol based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. The protocol assumes only public parameters-specifically, a \common reference string\""-which can be \""hardcoded\"" into an implementation of the protocol; in particular, and in contrast to some previous work, our protocol does not require either party to pre-share a public key. The protocol is also remarkably efficient, requiring computation only (roughly) 4 times greater than \""classical\"" Diffie-Hellman key exchange that provides no authentication at all.

Classes of conjunctive queries or constraint satisfaction problems whose associated hypergraphs have bounded GHW are known to be solvable in polynomial time. However, it has been an open problem for several years if for a fixed constant k and input hypergraph H it can be determined in polynomial time whether GHW(H) <= k. Here, this problem is settled by proving that even for k = 3 the problem is already NP-hard. On the way to this result, another long standing open problem, originally raised by Goodman and Shmueli [1984] in the context of join optimization is solved. It is proven that determining whether a hypergraph H admits a tree projection with respect to a hypergraph G is NP-complete. Our intractability results on generalized hypertree width motivate further research on more restrictive tractable hypergraph decomposition methods that approximate generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD). We show that each such method is dominated by a tractable decomposition method definable through a function that associates a set of partial edges to a hypergraph.

There is a fundamental distinction, however, between the theoretical approaches to the embedding problem and this recent Internet-related work: in addition to computational limitations, Internet measurement algorithms operate under the constraint that it is only feasible to measure distances for a linear (or near-linear) number of node pairs, and typically in a highly structured way. Indeed, the most common framework for Internet measurements of this type is a beacon-based approach: one chooses uniformly at random a constant number of nodes (\beacons\"") in the network, each node measures its distance to all beacons, and one then has access to only these measurements for the remainder of the algorithm. Moreover, beacon-based algorithms are often designed not for embedding but for the more basic problem of triangulation, in which one uses the triangle inequality to infer the distances that have not been measured. Here we give algorithms with provable performance guarantees for beacon-based triangulation and embedding. We show that in addition to multiplicative error in the distances, performance guarantees for beacon-based algorithms typically must include a notion of slack-acertain fraction of all distances may be arbitrarily distorted. For metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension (which have been proposed as a reasonable abstraction of Internet latencies), we show that triangulation-based distance reconstruction with a constant number of beacons can achieve multiplicative error 1 + delta on a 1 - epsilon fraction of distances, for arbitrarily small constants delta and epsilon. For this same class of metric spaces, we give a beacon-based embedding algorithm that achieves constant distortion on a 1 - epsilon fraction of distances; this provides some theoretical justification for the success of the recent Global Network Positioning algorithm of Ng and Zhang [2002], and it forms an interesting contrast with lower bounds showing that it is not possible to embed all distances in a doubling metric space with constant distortion. We also give results for other classes of metric spaces, as well as distributed algorithms that require only a sparse set of distances but do not place too much measurement load on any one node."""

The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size (O) over tilde (n(2)) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of (O) over tilde (n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are (O) over tilde (n(4)) and (O) over tilde (n(2)), respectively).

In particular, query containment has been studied extensively for fragments of the 1.0 version of this standard, whereas little is known about query containment in (fragments of) the richer language XPath 2.0. In this article, we consider extensions of CoreXPath, the navigational core of XPath 1.0, with operators that are part of or inspired by XPath 2.0: path intersection, path equality, path complementation, for-loops, and transitive closure. For each combination of these operators, we determine the complexity of query containment, both with and without DTDs. It turns out to range from EXPTIME (for extensions with path equality) and 2-EXPTIME (for extensions with path intersection) to non-elementary (for extensions with path complementation or for-loops). In almost all cases, adding transitive closure on top has no further impact on the complexity. We also investigate the effect of dropping the upward and/or sibling axes, and show that this sometimes leads to a reduction in complexity. Since the languages we study include negation and conjunction in filters, our complexity results can equivalently be stated in terms of satisfiability. We also analyze the above languages in terms of succinctness."

This work explores how well the ideal RAM performance can be approximated, for significant classes of computations, by machines whose building blocks have constant size and are connected at a constant distance. A novel memory structure is proposed, which is pipelined (can accept a new request at each cycle) and hierarchical, exhibiting optimal latency a(x)=O(x(1/d)) to address x, in d-dimensional realizations. In spite of block-transfer or other memory-pipeline capabilities, a number of previous machine models do not achieve a full overlap of memory accesses. These are examples of machines with explicit data movement. It is shown that there are direct-flow computations (without branches and indirect accesses) that require time superlinear in the number of instructions, on all such machines. To circumvent the explicit-data-movement constraints, the Speculative Prefetcher (SP) and the Speculative Prefetcher and Evaluator (SPE) processors are developed. Both processors can execute any direct-flow program in linear time. The SPE also executes in linear time a class of loop programs that includes many significant algorithms. Even quicksort, a somewhat irregular, recursive algorithm admits a linear-time SPE implementation. A relation between instructions called address dependence is introduced, which limits memory-access overlap and can lead to superlinear time, as illustrated with the classical merging algorithm."

Despite that, the way to analyze such recursive algorithms is still far from producing tight worst-case running time bounds. Motivated by this, we use an approach, that we call \Measure& Conquer\"", as an attempt to step beyond such limitations. The approach is based on the careful design of a nonstandard measure of the subproblem size; this measure is then used to lower bound the progress made by the algorithm at each branching step. The idea is that a smarter measure may capture behaviors of the algorithm that a standard measure might not be able to exploit, and hence lead to a significantly better worst-case time analysis. In order to show the potentialities of Measure & Conquer, we consider two well-studied NP-hard problems: minimum dominating set and maximum independent set. For the first problem, we consider the current best algorithm, and prove (thanks to a better measure) a much tighter running time bound for it. For the second problem, we describe a new, simple algorithm, and show that its running time is competitive with the current best time bounds, achieved with far more complicated algorithms (and standard analysis). Our examples show that a good choice of the measure, made in the very first stages of exact algorithms design, can have a tremendous impact on the running time bounds achievable."""

This algorithm leads to the following applications for the general setting of unrelated parallel machines: (i) a bicriteria algorithm for a schedule whose weighted completion-time and makespan simultaneously exhibit the current-best individual approximations for these criteria; (ii) better-than-two approximation guarantees for scheduling to minimize the L(p) norm of the vector of machine-loads, for all 1 < p < infinity; and (iii) the first constant-factor multicriteria approximation algorithms that can handle the weighted completion-time and any given collection of integer L(p) norms.

Yet, obtaining this graph structure can be a surprisingly difficult task, as edges cannot be explicitly queried. For instance, empirical studies of the network of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses typically rely on indirect methods like traceroute to build what are approximately single-source, all-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction of the network's edges, and a paper by Lakhina et al. [2003] found empirically that the resulting sample is intrinsically biased. Further, in simulations, they observed that the degree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when the underlying degree distribution is Poisson. In this article, we study the bias of traceroute sampling mathematically and, for a very general class of underlying degree distributions, explicitly calculate the distribution that will be observed. As example applications of our machinery, we prove that traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions in both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our work puts the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends them to nearly arbitrary degree distributions."

A cost-sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which participants are allocated a good and at what prices. Three desirable properties of a cost-sharing mechanism are: incentive-compatibility, meaning that participants are motivated to bid their true private value for receiving the good; budget-balance, meaning that the mechanism recovers its incurred cost with the prices charged; and economic efficiency, meaning that the cost incurred and the value to the participants are traded off in an optimal way. These three goals have been known to be mutually incompatible for thirty years. Nearly all the work on cost-sharing mechanism design by the economics and computer science communities has focused on achieving two of these goals while completely ignoring the third. We introduce novel measures for quantifying efficiency loss in cost-sharing mechanisms and prove simultaneous approximate budget-balance and approximate efficiency guarantees for mechanisms for a wide range of cost-sharing problems, including all submodular and Steiner tree problems. Our key technical tool is an exact characterization of worst-case efficiency loss in Moulin mechanisms, the dominant paradigm in cost-sharing mechanism design."

Examples of data with such dual linear-hierarchical structure include executions of structured programs, annotated linguistic data, and HTML/XML documents. Nested words generalize both words and ordered trees, and allow both word and tree operations. We define nested word automata-finite-state acceptors for nested words, and show that the resulting class of regular languages of nested words has all the appealing theoretical properties that the classical regular word languages enjoys: deterministic nested word automata are as expressive as their nondeterministic counterparts; the class is closed under union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, Kleene-*, prefixes, and language homomorphisms; membership, emptiness, language inclusion, and language equivalence are all decidable; and definability in monadic second order logic corresponds exactly to finite-state recognizability. We also consider regular languages of infinite nested words and show that the closure properties, MSO-characterization, and decidability of decision problems carry over. The linear encodings of nested words give the class of visibly pushdown languages of words, and this class lies between balanced languages and deterministic context-free languages. We argue that for algorithmic verification of structured programs, instead of viewing the program as a context-free language over words, one should view it as a regular language of nested words ( or equivalently, a visibly pushdown language), and this would allow model checking of many properties (such as stack inspection, pre-post conditions) that are not expressible in existing specification logics. We also study the relationship between ordered trees and nested words, and the corresponding automata: while the analysis complexity of nested word automata is the same as that of classical tree automata, they combine both bottom-up and top-down traversals, and enjoy expressiveness and succinctness benefits over tree automata."

The most constrained resources in such a situation are the size of the main memory and the number of random accesses to external memory. We note that sequentially streaming data from external memory through main memory is much less prohibitive. We propose an abstract model of this scenario in which we restrict the size of the main memory and the number of random accesses to external memory, but admit arbitrary sequential access. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it allows the usage of unlimited external memory for storing intermediate results, such as several hard disks that can be accessed in parallel. In this model, we prove lower bounds for the problem of sorting a sequence of strings (or numbers), the problem of deciding whether two given sets of strings are equal, and two closely related decision problems. Intuitively, our results say that there is no algorithm for the problems that uses internal memory space bounded by N(1-epsilon) and at most o( log N) random accesses to external memory, but unlimited \streaming access\"", both for writing to and reading from external memory. (Here, N denotes the size of the input and e is an arbitrary constant greater than 0.) We even permit randomized algorithms with one-sided bounded error.

The value of these constants remains unknown, and a number of papers have proved upper and lower bounds on them. We discuss techniques, involving numerical calculations with recurrences on many variables, for determining lower and upper bounds on these constants. To our knowledge, the previous best-known lower and upper bounds for gamma(2) were those of Dancik and Paterson, approximately 0.773911 and 0.837623 [ Dancik 1994; Dancik and Paterson 1995]. We improve these to 0.788071 and 0.826280. This upper bound is less than the gamma(2) given by Steele's old conjecture (see Steele [1997, page 3]) that gamma(2) = 2/(1 + root 2) approximate to 0.828427. ( As Steele points out, experimental evidence had already suggested that this conjectured value was too high.) Finally, we show that the upper bound technique described here could be used to produce, for any k, a sequence of upper bounds converging to gamma(k), though the computation time grows very quickly as better bounds are guaranteed."

An important application of our work is to approximating the partition function Z of a discrete system, such as the Ising model, matchings or colorings of a graph. The typical approach to estimating the partition function Z(beta*) at some desired inverse temperature beta* is to define a sequence, which we call a cooling schedule, beta(0) = 0 < beta(1) < center dot center dot center dot < beta(l) = beta* where Z(0) is trivial to compute and the ratios Z(beta(i+1))/Z(beta(i)) are easy to estimate by sampling from the distribution corresponding to Z(beta(i)). Previous approaches required a cooling schedule of length O*(In A) where A = Z(0), thereby ensuring that each ratio Z(beta(i+1))/Z(beta(i)) is bounded. We present a cooling schedule of length l = O*(root In A). For well-studied problems such as estimating the partition function of the Ising model, or approximating the number of colorings or matchings of a graph, our cooling schedule is of length O*(root n), which implies an overall savings of O*(n) in the running time of the approximate counting algorithm (since roughly l samples are needed to estimate each ratio). A similar improvement in the length of the cooling schedule was recently obtained by Lovasz and Vempala in the context of estimating the volume of convex bodies. While our reduction is inspired by theirs, the discrete analogue of their result turns out to be significantly more difficult. Whereas a fixed schedule suffices in their setting, we prove that in the discrete setting we need an adaptive schedule, that is, the schedule depends on Z. More precisely, we prove any nonadaptive cooling schedule has length at least O*(In A), and we present an algorithm to find an adaptive schedule of length O*(root In A)."

Today's wealth of sequenced genomes makes it increasingly important to understand evolutionary events such as duplications, losses, transpositions, inversions, lateral transfers, and domain shuffling. We focus on the gene duplication event, that constitutes a major force in the creation of genes with new function [Ohno 1970; Lynch and Force 2000] and, thereby also, of biodiversity. We introduce the probabilistic gene evolution model, which describes how a gene tree evolves within a given species tree with respect to speciation, gene duplication, and gene loss. The actual relation between gene tree and species tree is captured by a reconciliation, a concept which we generalize for more expressiveness. The model is a canonical generalization of the classical linear birth-death process, obtained by replacing the interval where the process takes place by a tree. For the gene evolution model, we derive efficient algorithms for some associated probability distributions: the probability of a reconciled tree, the probability of a gene tree, the maximum probability reconciliation, the posterior probability of a reconciliation, and sampling reconciliations with respect to the posterior probability. These algorithms provides the basis for several applications, including species tree construction, reconciliation analysis, orthology analysis, biogeography, and host-parasite co-evolution."

In the multicut problem, we are a given an n-vertex graph G along with k source-sink pairs, and the goal is to find the minimum cardinality subset of edges whose removal separates all source-sink pairs. The sparsest cut problem has the same input, but the goal is to find a subset of edges to delete so as to minimize the ratio of the number of deleted edges to the number of source-sink pairs that are separated by this deletion. The natural linear programming relaxation for multicut corresponds, by LP-duality, to the well-studied maximum (fractional) multicommodity flow problem, while the standard LP-relaxation for sparsest cut corresponds to maximum concurrent flow. Therefore, the integrality gap of the linear programming relaxation for multicut/sparsest cut is also the flow-cut gap: the largest gap, achievable for any graph, between the maximum flow value and the minimum cost solution for the corresponding cut problem. Our first result is that the flow-cut gap between maximum multicommodity flow and minimum multicut is (Omega) over tilde (n(1/7)) in directed graphs. We show a similar result for the gap between maximum concurrent flow and sparsest cut in directed graphs. These results improve upon a long-standing lower bound of Omega(log n) for both types of flow-cut gaps. We notice that these polynomially large flow-cut gaps are in a sharp contrast to the undirected setting where both these flow-cut gaps are known to be Theta(log n). Our second result is that both directed multicut and sparsest cut are hard to approximate to within a factor of 2(Omega(log1-epsilon n)) for any constant epsilon > 0, unless NP subset of ZPP. This improves upon the recent Omega(log n/log log n)-hardness result for these problems. We also show that existence of PCP's for NP with perfect completeness, polynomially small soundness, and constant number of queries would imply a polynomial factor hardness of approximation for both these problems.

The method applies to permutations that can be represented as linear mappings on the bit-level representation of the data locations. This subclass includes many important permutations such as stride permutations (corner turn, perfect shuffle, etc.), the bit reversal, the Hadamard reordering, and the Gray code reordering. The datapath for performing the streaming permutation consists of several independent banks of memory and two interconnection networks. These structures are built for a given streaming width (i.e., number of inputs and outputs per cycle) and operate at full throughput for this streaming width. We provide an algorithm that completely specifies the datapath and control logic given the desired permutation and streaming width. Further, we provide lower bounds on the achievable cost of a solution and show that for an important subclass of permutations our solution is optimal. We apply our algorithm to derive datapaths for several important permutations, including a detailed example that carefully illustrates each aspect of the design process. Lastly, we compare our permutation structures to those of Jarvinen et al. [2004], which are specialized for stride permutations."

This technique works for any single value domain, in which each agent has the same value for each desired outcome, and this value is the only private information. In particular, for \single-value CAs\"", where each player desires any one of several different bundles but has the same value for each of them, our technique converts any approximation algorithm to a dominant strategy mechanism that almost preserves the original approximation ratio. Our second result provides the first computationally efficient deterministic mechanism for the case of single-value multi-minded bidders (with private value and private desired bundles). The mechanism achieves an approximation to the social welfare which is close to the best possible in polynomial time (unless P=NP).

Informally, an RMC consists of a collection of finite-state Markov chains with the ability to invoke each other in a potentially recursive manner. RMCs offer a natural abstract model for probabilistic programs with procedures. They generalize, in a precise sense, a number of well-studied stochastic models, including Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFG) and Multi-Type Branching Processes (MT-BP). We focus on algorithms for reachability and termination analysis for RMCs: what is the probability that an RMC started from a given state reaches another target state, or that it terminates? These probabilities are in general irrational, and they arise as (least) fixed point solutions to certain (monotone) systems of nonlinear equations associated with RMCs. We address both the qualitative problem of determining whether the probabilities are 0, 1 or in-between, and the quantitative problems of comparing the probabilities with a given bound, or approximating them to desired precision. We show that all these problems can be solved in PSPACE using a decision procedure for the Existential Theory of Reals. We provide a more practical algorithm, based on a decomposed version of multi-variate Newton's method, and prove that it always converges monotonically to the desired probabilities. We show this method applies more generally to any monotone polynomial system. We obtain polynomial-time algorithms for various special subclasses of RMCs. Among these: for SCFGs and MT-BPs (equivalently, for 1-exit RMCs) the qualitative problem can be solved in P-time; for linearly recursive RMCs the probabilities are rational and can be computed exactly in P-time. We show that our PSPACE upper bounds cannot be substantially improved without a breakthrough on long standing open problems: the square-root sum problem and an arithmetic circuit decision problem that captures P-time on the unit-cost rational arithmetic RAM model. We show that these problems reduce to the qualitative problem and to the approximation problem (to within any nontrivial error) for termination probabilities of general RMCs, and to the quantitative decision problem for termination (extinction) of SCFGs (MT-BPs)."

To verify that the file has not been corrupted, a user could store a small private (randomized) \fingerprint\"" on his own computer. This is the setting for the well-studied authentication problem in cryptography, and the required fingerprint size is well understood. We study the problem of sublinear authentication: suppose the user would like to encode and store the file in a way that allows him to verify that it has not been corrupted, but without reading the entire file. If the user only wants to read q bits of the file, how large does the size s of the private fingerprint need to be? We define this problem formally, and show a tight lower bound on the relationship between s and q when the adversary is not computationally bounded, namely: s x q = Omega(n), where n is the file size. This is an easier case of the online memory checking problem, introduced by Blum et al. [1991], and hence the same (tight) lower bound applies also to that problem. It was previously shown that, when the adversary is computationally bounded, under the assumption that one-way functions exist, it is possible to construct much better online memory checkers. The same is also true for sublinear authentication schemes. We show that the existence of one-way functions is also a necessary condition: even slightly breaking the s x q = Omega(n) lower bound in a computational setting implies the existence of one-way functions."""

Darwin's theory of evolution suggests that such mechanisms evolved through variation guided by natural selection. However, there has existed no theory that would explain quantitatively which mechanisms can so evolve in realistic population sizes within realistic time periods, and which are too complex. In this article, we suggest such a theory. We treat Darwinian evolution as a form of computational learning from examples in which the course of learning is influenced only by the aggregate fitness of the hypotheses on the examples, and not otherwise by specific examples. We formulate a notion of evolvability that distinguishes function classes that are evolvable with polynomially bounded resources from those that are not. We show that in a single stage of evolution monotone Boolean conjunctions and disjunctions are evolvable over the uniform distribution, while Boolean parity functions are not. We suggest that the mechanism that underlies biological evolution overall is \evolvable target pursuit\"", which consists of a series of evolutionary stages, each one inexorably pursuing an evolvable target in the technical sense suggested above, each such target being rendered evolvable by the serendipitous combination of the environment and the outcomes of previous evolutionary stages."""

For point sets along the moment curve in R(d) we construct weak 1/r-nets of size r . 2(poly(alpha(r))), where the degree of the polynomial in the exponent depends (quadratically) on d. Our constructions result from a reduction to a new problem, which we call stabbing interval chains with j-tuples. Given the range of integers N = [1, n], an interval chain of length k is a sequence of k consecutive, disjoint, nonempty intervals contained in N. A j-tuple (p) over bar = (p(1),..., p(j)) is said to stab an interval chain C = I(1) ... I(k) if each p(i) falls on a different interval of C. The problem is to construct a small-size family Z of j-tuples that stabs all k-interval chains in N. Let z(k)((j)) (n) denote the minimum size of such a family Z. We derive almost-tight upper and lower bounds for z(k)((j)) (n) for every fixed j; our bounds involve functions am(n) of the inverse Ackermann hierarchy.

Magnetic disk storage is over two orders of magnitude cheaper than semiconductor memory, and individual disks can hold up to a terabyte. We augment memory with magnetic disks to perform brute-force and heuristic searches that are orders of magnitude larger than any previous such searches. The main difficulty is detecting duplicate nodes, which is normally done with a hash table. Due to long disk latencies, however, randomly accessed hash tables are infeasible on disk, and are replaced by a mechanism we call delayed duplicate detection. In contrast to previous work, we perform delayed duplicate detection without sorting, which runs in time linear in the number of nodes in practice. Using this technique, we performed the first complete breadth-first searches of the 2 x 7, 3 x 5, 4 x 4, and 2 x 8 sliding-tile Puzzles, verifying the radius of the 4 x 4 puzzle and determining the radius of the others.

Wait-free consensus, in which a process always terminates within a finite number of its own steps, is impossible in an asynchronous shared-memory system. However, consensus becomes solvable using randomization when a process only has to terminate with probability 1. Randomized consensus algorithms are typically evaluated by their total step complexity, which is the expected total number of steps taken by all processes. This article proves that the total step complexity of randomized consensus is Theta(n(2)) in an asynchronous shared memory system using multi-writer multi-reader registers. This result is achieved by improving both the lower and the upper bounds for this problem. In addition to improving upon the best previously known result by a factor of log(2) n, the lower bound features a greatly streamlined proof. Both goals are achieved through restricting attention to a set of layered executions and using an isoperimetric inequality for analyzing their behavior. The matching algorithm decreases the expected total step complexity by a log n factor, by leveraging the multi-writing capability of the shared registers. Its correctness proof is facilitated by viewing each execution of the algorithm as a stochastic process and applying Kolmogorov's inequality."

Such a primitive is particularly useful in creating objective benchmarks for search engines. The technique of Bharat and Broder suffers from a well-recorded bias: it favors long documents. In this article we introduce two novel sampling algorithms: a lexicon-based algorithm and a random walk algorithm. Our algorithms produce biased samples, but each sample is accompanied by a weight, which represents its bias. The samples, in conjunction with the weights, are then used to simulate near-uniform samples. To this end, we resort to four well-known Monte Carlo simulation methods: rejection sampling, importance sampling, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the Maximum Degree method. The limited access to search engines force our algorithms to use bias weights that are only \approximate\"". We characterize analytically the effect of approximate bias weights on Monte Carlo methods and conclude that our algorithms are guaranteed to produce near-uniform samples from the search engine's corpus. Our study of approximate Monte Carlo methods could be of independent interest. Experiments on a corpus of 2.4 million documents substantiate our analytical findings and show that our algorithms do not have significant bias towards long documents. We use our algorithms to collect comparative statistics about the corpora of the Google, MSN Search, and Yahoo! search engines."""

We present a communication optimal maintenance of a spanning tree in a dynamic network. The amortized ( on the number of topological changes) message complexity is O(V), where V is the number of nodes in the network. The message size used by the algorithm is O(log |ID|) where |ID| is the size of the name space of the nodes. Typically, log |ID| = O( log V). Previous algorithms that adapt to dynamic networks involved Omega( E) messages per topological change - inherently paying for re- computation of the tree from scratch. Spanning trees are essential components in many distributed algorithms. Some examples include broadcast ( dissemination of messages to all network nodes), multicast, reset ( general adaptation of static algorithms to dynamic networks), routing, termination detection, and more. Thus, our efficient maintenance of a spanning tree implies the improvement of algorithms for these tasks. Our results are obtained using a novel technique to save communication.

A high-level security policy states an overall requirement for a sensitive task. One example of a high-level security policy is a separation of duty policy, which requires a task to be performed by a team of at least k users. Unlike low-level enforcement schemes such as security constraints in workflows, a separation of duty policy states a high-level requirement about the task without referring to individual steps in the task. While extremely important and widely used, separation of duty policies state only requirements on the number of users involved in the task and do not capture the requirements on these users' attributes. In this article, we introduce a novel algebra that enables the formal specification of high-level policies that combine requirements on users' attributes with requirements on the number of users motivated by separation of duty considerations.

The processors are identically programmed but have distinct identities, taken from {0, 1, ..., M - 1}. We investigate the communication costs of three well studied tasks: Consensus, Leader, and MaxF (finding the maximum identity). We show that in chain and ring topologies, the message complexities of all three tasks are the same. Hence, we study a finer measure of complexity: the number of transmitted bits required to solve a task T, denoted BitC(T). We prove several new lower bounds (and some simple upper bounds) that imply the following results: For the two processors case, BitC(Consensus) = 2 and BitC(Leader) = BitC(MaxF) =2 log(2) M +/- O(1), where the gap between the lower and upper bounds is almost always 1. For a chain, BitC(Consensus) = Theta (n), BitC(Leader) = Theta (n + log M), and BitC(MaxF) = Theta (n log M). For the ring topology, we prove the lower bound of Omega (n log M) for Leader, and (hence) MaxF. We consider also a chain where the intermediate processors have no identities. We prove that BitC(Leader) = Theta (n log M), which is equal to n times the bit complexity of the problem for two processors. For the specific case when the chain length is even, we prove that BitC(Leader) = Theta (n), for both above settings. In addition, we show that for any algorithm solving MaxF, there exists an input, for which every execution has the bit complexity Omega (n log M) (this is not the case for Leader).

Due to the wide use of XPath, which is embedded into several languages for querying and manipulating XML data, the problem of efficiently answering XPath queries has received increasing attention from the research community. As the efficiency of computing the answer of an XPath query depends on its size, replacing XPath expressions with equivalent ones having the smallest size is a crucial issue in this direction. This article investigates the minimization problem for a wide fragment of XPath (namely XP([*])), where the use of the most common operators (child, descendant, wildcard and branching) is allowed with some syntactic restrictions. The examined fragment consists of expressions which have not been specifically studied in the relational setting before: neither are they mere conjunctive queries (as the combination of \//\"" and \""*\"" enables an implicit form of disjunction to be expressed) nor do they coincide with disjunctive ones (as the latter are more expressive). Three main contributions are provided. The \""global minimality\"" property is shown to hold: the minimization of a given XPath expression can be accomplished by removing pieces of the expression, without having to re-formulate it (as for \""general\"" disjunctive queries). Then, the complexity of the minimization problem is characterized, showing that it is the same as the containment problem. Finally, specific forms of XPath expressions are identified, which can be minimized in polynomial time."""

We give new constructions of three query LDCs of vastly shorter length than that of previous constructions. Specifically, given any Mersenne prime p = 2(t) - 1, we design three query LDCs of length N = exp(O(n(1/t))), for every n. Based on the largest known Mersenne prime, this translates to a length of less than exp(O(n(10) (7))), compared to exp(O(n(1/2))) in the previous constructions. It has often been conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. Under this conjecture, our constructions yield three query locally decodable codes of length N = exp(n(O(1/log log n))) for infinitely many n. We also obtain analogous improvements for Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. We give 3-server PIR schemes with communication complexity of O(n(10-7)) to access an n-bit database, compared to the previous best scheme with complexity O(n(1/5.25)). Assuming again that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, we get 3-server PIR schemes of communication complexity n(O(1/log log n)) for infinitely many n. Previous families of LDCs and PIR schemes were based on the properties of low-degree multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our constructions are completely different and are obtained by constructing a large number of vectors in a small dimensional vector space whose inner products are restricted to lie in an algebraically nice set."

This result was substantially extended by Senizergues [1998, 2005] who showed the decidability of bisimilarity for regular (or equational) graphs of finite out-degree; this essentially coincides with weak bisimilarity of processes generated by (unnormed) pushdown automata where the e-transitions can only deterministically pop the stack. The question of decidability of bisimilarity for the more general class of so called Type -1 systems, which is equivalent to weak bisimilarity on unrestricted e-popping pushdown processes, was left open. This was repeatedly indicated by both Stirling and Senizergues. Here we answer the question negatively, that is, we show the undecidability of bisimilarity on Type -1 systems, even in the normed case. We achieve the result by applying a technique we call Defender's Forcing, referring to the bisimulation games. The idea is simple, yet powerful. We demonstrate its versatility by deriving further results in a uniform way. First, we classify several versions of the undecidable problems for prefix rewrite systems (or pushdown automata) as Pi(0)(1)-complete or Sigma(1)(1)-complete. Second, we solve the decidability question for weak bisimilarity on PA (Process Algebra) processes, showing that the problem is undecidable and even Sigma(1)(1)-complete.

We define XML data exchange settings in which source-to-target dependencies refer to the hierarchical structure of the data. Combining DTDs and dependencies makes some XML data exchange settings inconsistent. We investigate the consistency problem and determine its exact complexity. We then move to query answering, and prove a dichotomy theorem that classifies data exchange settings into those over which query answering is tractable, and those over which it is coNP-complete, depending on classes of regular expressions used in DTDs.

We first study the problem for negation-free XPath fragments with and without upward axes, recursion and data-value joins, identifying which factors lead to tractability and which to NP-completeness. We then turn to fragments with negation but without data values, establishing lower and upper bounds in the absence and in the presence of upward modalities and recursion. We show that with negation the complexity ranges from PSPACE to EXPTIME. Moreover, when both data values and negation are in place, we find that the complexity ranges from NEXPTIME to undecidable.

They stated as an important open problem whether the core can be computed in polynomial time in the general setting where the mapping between the source and target schemas is given by source-to-target constraints that are arbitrary tuple generating dependencies (tgds) and target constraints consisting of equality generating dependencies (egds) and a weakly acyclic set of tgds.

This positive result shows that data exchange based on cores is feasible and applicable in a very general setting. In addition to our main result, we use the method of hypertree decompositions to derive new algorithms and upper bounds for query containment checking and computing cores of arbitrary database instances.

Applied to Internet traffic analysis, the items could be records summarizing the flows of packets streaming by a router. Subsets could be flow records from different time intervals of a worm attack whose signature is later determined. The samples taken in the past thus allow us to trace the history of the attack even though the worm was unknown at the time of sampling. Estimation from the samples must be accurate even with heavy-tailed distributions where most of the weight is concentrated on a few heavy items. We want the sample to be weight sensitive, giving priority to heavy items. At the same time, we want sampling without replacement in order to avoid selecting heavy items multiple times. To fulfill these requirements we introduce priority sampling, which is the first weight-sensitive sampling scheme without replacement that works in a streaming context and is suitable for estimating subset sums. Testing priority sampling on Internet traffic analysis, we found it to perform an order of magnitude better than previous schemes. Priority sampling is simple to define and implement: we consider a steam of items i = 0,..., n-1 with weights w(i). For each item i, we generate a random number alpha(i). ( 0, 1] and create a priority q(i) = w(i)/ a(i). The sample S consists of the k highest priority items. Let tau be the ( k + 1)th highest priority. Each sampled item i in S gets a weight estimate (w) over cap (w) over cap (i) = max{w(i), tau}, while nonsampled items get weight estimate (w) over cap (i) wi = 0. Magically, it turns out that the weight estimates are unbiased, that is, E[(w) over cap (i)] = w(i), and by linearity of expectation, we get unbiased estimators over any subset sum simply by adding the sampled weight estimates from the subset. Also, we can estimate the variance of the estimates, and find, surprisingly, that the covariance between estimates (w) over cap (i) and (w) over cap (i) w j of different weights is zero. Finally, we conjecture an extremely strong near-optimality; namely that for any weight sequence, there exists no specialized scheme for sampling k items with unbiased weight estimators that gets smaller variance sum than priority sampling with k + 1 items. Szegedy settled this conjecture at STOC' 06.

Thus, if P not equal NP, it is not possible to classify NP using any finite collection of complexity classes. This situation has led to attempts to identify smaller classes of problems within NP where dichotomy results may hold: every problem is either in P or is NP-complete. A similar situation exists for counting problems. If P not equal# P, there is an infinite hierarchy in between and it is important to identify subclasses of # P where dichotomy results hold. Graph homomorphism problems are a fertile setting in which to explore dichotomy theorems. Indeed, Feder and Vardi have shown that a dichotomy theorem for the problem of deciding whether there is a homomorphism to a fixed directed acyclic graph would resolve their long-standing dichotomy conjecture for all constraint satisfaction problems. In this article, we give a dichotomy theorem for the problem of counting homomorphisms to directed acyclic graphs. Let H be a fixed directed acyclic graph. The problem is, given an input digraph G, determine how many homomorphisms there are from G to H. We give a graph-theoretic classification, showing that for some digraphs H, the problem is in P and for the rest of the digraphs H the problem is #P-complete. An interesting feature of the dichotomy, which is absent from previously known dichotomy results, is that there is a rich supply of tractable graphs H with complex structure."

Conversely, a priority queue can trivially be used for sorting: first insert all keys to be sorted, then extract them in sorted order by repeatedly deleting the minimum. Asymptotically, this settles the complexity of priority queues in terms of that of sorting. Previously, at SODA' 96, such a result was presented by the author for the special case of monotone priority queues where the minimum is not allowed to decrease. Besides nailing down the complexity of priority queues to that of sorting, and vice versa, our result yields several improved bounds for linear space integer priority queues with find-min in constant time: Deterministically. We get O( log log n) update time using a sorting algorithm of Han from STOC' 02. This improves the O(( log log n)( log log log n)) update time of Han from SODA'01. Randomized. We get O(root log log n) expected update time using a randomized sorting algorithm of Han and Thorup from FOCS'02. This improves the O( log log n) expected update time of Thorup from SODA'96.

We introduce a simple technique for accelerating the computation of such approximations when A has strong spectral features, that is, when the singular values of interest are significantly greater than those of a random matrix with size and entries similar to A. Our technique amounts to independently sampling and/or quantizing the entries of A, thus speeding up computation by reducing the number of nonzero entries and/or the length of their representation. Our analysis is based on observing that the acts of sampling and quantization can be viewed as adding a random matrix N to A, whose entries are independent random variables with zero-mean and bounded variance. Since, with high probability, N has very weak spectral features, we can prove that the effect of sampling and quantization nearly vanishes when a low-rank approximation to A + N is computed.

Essentially, this class contains unnested SQL queries with the above aggregate operators, with a where clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons, and without a having clause. The comparisons are either interpreted over a domain with a dense order (like the rationals) or with a discrete order (like the integers). Characterizations of equivalence differ for the two cases. For queries with either max or min, equivalence is characterized in terms of dominance mappings, which can be viewed as a generalization of containment mappings. For queries with the count-distinct operator, a sufficient condition for equivalence is given in terms of equivalence of conjunctive queries under set semantics. For some special cases, it is shown that this condition is also necessary. For conjunctive queries with comparisons but without aggregation, equivalence under bag-set semantics is characterized in terms of isomorphism. This characterization essentially remains the same also for queries with the count operator. Moreover, this characterization also applies to queries with the sum operator if the queries have either constants or comparisons, but not both. In the general case (i.e., both comparisons andconstants), the characterization of the equivalence of queries with the sum operator is more elaborate.

This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model that is based on unitary operations. Among measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way quantum computer [Raussendorf and Briegel 2001] stands out as fundamental. We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs, which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning locally and compositionally about these patterns. We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form. Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems. Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models, for example, Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is not just particular to the one-way quantum computer."

We study policies for setting the speed of the processor for both of the goals of minimizing the energy used and the maximum temperature attained. The theoretical study of speed scaling policies to manage energy was initiated in a seminal paper by Yao et al. [1995], and we adopt their setting. We assume that the power required to run at speed s is P(s) = s(alpha) for some constant alpha > 1. We assume a collection of tasks, each with a release time, a deadline, and an arbitrary amount of work that must be done between the release time and the deadline. Yao et al. [1995] gave an offline greedy algorithm YDS to compute the minimum energy schedule. They further proposed two online algorithms Average Rate (AVR) and Optimal Available (OA), and showed that AVR is 2(alpha-1) alpha(alpha)-competitive with respect to energy. We provide a tight alpha(alpha) bound on the competitive ratio of OA with respect to energy. We initiate the study of speed scaling to manage temperature. We assume that the environment has a fixed ambient temperature and that the device cools according to Newton's law of cooling. We observe that the maximum temperature can be approximated within a factor of two by the maximum energy used over any interval of length 1/b, where b is the cooling parameter of the device. We define a speed scaling policy to be cooling-oblivious if it is simultaneously constant-competitive with respect to temperature for all cooling parameters. We then observe that cooling-oblivious algorithms are also constant-competitive with respect to energy, maximum speed and maximum power. We show that YDS is a cooling-oblivious algorithm. In contrast, we show that the online algorithms OA and AVR are not cooling-oblivious. We then propose a new online algorithm that we call BKP. We show that BKP is cooling-oblivious. We further show that BKP is e-competitive with respect to the maximum speed, and that no deterministic online algorithm can have a better competitive ratio. BKP also has a lower competitive ratio for energy than OA for alpha >= 5."

These relations can be generated from two given well-founded orderings, on the function symbols and on the type constructors. The obtained orderings on terms are well founded, monotonic, stable under substitution and include beta-reductions. They can be used to prove the strong normalization property of higher-order calculi in which constants can be defined by higher-order rewrite rules using first-order pattern matching. For example, the polymorphic version of Godel's recursor for the natural numbers is easily oriented. And indeed, our ordering is polymorphic, in the sense that a single comparison allows to prove the termination property of all monomorphic instances of a polymorphic rewrite rule. Many nontrivial examples are given that exemplify the expressive power of these orderings. All have been checked by our implementation. This article is an extended and improved version of Jouannaud and Rubio [1999]. Polymorphic algebras have been made more expressive than in our previous framework. The intuitive notion of a polymorphic higher-order ordering has now been made precise. The higher-order recursive path ordering itself has been made much more powerful by replacing the congruence on types used there by an ordering on types satisfying some abstract properties. Besides, using a restriction of Dershowitz's recursive path ordering for comparing types, we can integrate both orderings into a single one operating uniformly on both terms and types."

In this article, we study single-commodity confluent flow problems, where we need to route given node demands to a single destination using a confluent flow. Single- and multi-commodity confluent flows arise in a variety of application areas, most notably in networking; in fact, most flows in the Internet are (multi-commodity) confluent flows since Internet routing is destination based. We present near-tight approximation algorithms, hardness results, and existence theorems for minimizing congestion in single-commodity confluent flows. The maximum edge congestion of a single-commodity confluent flow occurs at one of the incoming edges of the destination. Therefore, finding a minimum-congestion confluent flow is equivalent to the following problem: given a directed graph G with k sinks and non-negative demands on all the nodes of G, determine a confluent flow that routes every node demand to some sink such that the maximum congestion at a sink is minimized. The main result of this article is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining a confluent flow with congestion at most 1 + ln(k) in G, if G admits a splittable flow with congestion at most 1. We complement this result in two directions. First, we present a graph G that admits a splittable flow with congestion at most 1, yet no confluent flow with congestion smaller than H(k), the kth harmonic number, thus establishing tight upper and lower bounds to within an additive constant less than 1. Second, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the congestion of an optimal confluent flow to within a factor of (1092 k)12, thus resolving the polynomial-time approximability to within a multiplicative constant. We also consider a demand maximization version of the problem. We show that if G admits a splittable flow of congestion at most 1, then a variant of the congestion minimization algorithm yields a confluent flow in G with congestion at most I that satisfies 1/3 fraction of total demand. We show that the gap between confluent flows and splittable flows is much smaller, if the underlying graph is k-connected. In particular, we prove that k-connected graphs with k sinks admit confluent flows of congestion less than C + d(max) where C is the congestion of the best splittable flow, and d(max) is the maximum demand of any node in G. The proof of this existence theorem is non-constructive and relies on topological techniques introduced by Lovdsz."

Voting is a general method for preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using protocols where deter-mining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by computational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. Such hardness results lose relevance when the number of candidates is small, because manipulation algorithms that are exponential only in the number of candidates (and only slightly so) might be available. We give such an algorithm for an individual agent to manipulate the Single Transferable Vote (STV) protocol, which has been shown hard to manipulate in the above sense. This motivates the core of this article, which derives hardness results for realistic elections where the number of candidates is a small constant (but the number of voters can be large). The main manipulation question we study is that of coalitional manipulation by weighted voters. 14 (We show that for simpler manipulation problems, manipulation cannot be hard with few candidates.) We study both constructive manipulation (making a given candidate win) and destructive manipulation (making a given candidate not win). We characterize the exact number of candidates for which manipulation becomes hard for the plurality, Borda, STV, Copeland, maximin, veto, plurality with runoff regular cup, and randomized cup protocols. We also show that hardness of manipulation in this setting implies hardness of manipulation by an individual in unweighted settings when there is uncertainty about the others' votes (but not vice-versa). To our knowledge, these are the first results on the hardness of manipulation when there is uncertainty about the others' votes."

We solve this problem in a framework where the cycles are closed walks on the vertex-edge graph of a combinatorial surface that may overlap but do not cross. We give an algorithm that transforms an input pants decomposition into another homotopic pants decomposition that is optimal: each cycle is as short as possible in its homotopy class. As a consequence, finding a shortest cycle homotopic to a given simple cycle amounts to extending the cycle into a pants decomposition and to optimizing it: the resulting pants decomposition contains the desired cycle.

The celebrated equivalence of this theorem and inapproximability of certain optimization problems, due to Feige et al. [1996], has placed the PCP theorem at the heart of the area of inapproximability. In this work, we present a new proof of the PCP theorem that draws on this equivalence. We give a combinatorial proof for the NP-hardness of approximating a certain constraint satisfaction problem, which can then be reinterpreted to yield the PUP theorem. Our approach is to consider the unsat value of a constraint system, which is the smallest fraction of unsatisfied constraints, ranging over all possible assignments for the underlying variables. We describe a new combinatorial amplification transformation that doubles the unsat-value of a constraint- system, with only a linear blowup in the size of the system. The amplification step causes an increase in alphabet-size that is corrected by a (standard) PCP composition step. Iterative application of these two steps yields a proof for the PCP theorem. The amplification lemma relies on a new notion of \graph powering\"" that can be applied to systems of binary constraints. This powering amplifies the unsat-value of a constraint system provided that the underlying graph structure is an expander. We also extend our amplification lemma towards construction of assignment testers (alternatively, PCPs of Proximity) which are slightly stronger objects than PCPs. We then construct PCPs and locally-testable codes whose length is linear up to a polylog factor, and whose correctness can be probabilistically verified by making a constant number of queries.

The computation of abductive explanations is an important computational problem, which is at the core of early systems such as the ATMS and Clause Management Systems and is intimately related to prime implicate generation in propositional logic. Many algorithms have been devised for computing some abductive explanation, and the complexity of the problem has been well studied. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of computing multiple explanations, and in particular all explanations for an abductive query. We fill this gap and consider the computation of all explanations of an abductive query from a propositional Horn theory, or of a polynomial subset of them. Our study pays particular attention to the form of the query, ranging from a literal to a compound formula, to whether explanations are based on a set of abducible literals and to the representation of the Horn theory, either by a Horn conjunctive normal form (CNF) or model-based in terms of its characteristic models. For these combinations, we present either tractability results in terms of polynomial total-time algorithms, intractability results in terms of nonexistence of such algorithms (unless P = NP), or semi-tractability results in terms of solvability in quasi-polynomial time, established by polynomial-time equivalence to the problem of dualizing a monotone CNF expression. Our results complement previous results in the literature, and refute a longstanding conjecture by Selman and Levesque. They elucidate the complexity of generating all abductive explanations and shed light on related problems such as generating sets of restricted prime implicates of a Horn theory. The algorithms for tractable cases can be readily applied for generating a polynomial subset of explanations in polynomial time."

To address this, we introduce the ordered game isomorphism and the related ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation. For a multi-player sequential game of imperfect information with observable actions and an ordered signal space, we prove that any Nash equilibrium in an abstracted smaller game, obtained by one or more applications of the transformation, can be easily converted into a Nash equilibrium in the original game. We present an algorithm, GameShrink, for abstracting the game using our isomorphism exhaustively. Its complexity is O(n(2)), where n is the number of nodes in a structure we call the signal tree. It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space complexity sublinear in the size of the game tree.

We first describe how any SAT formula can be associated with a novel family of Markov random fields (MRFs), parameterized by a real number P epsilon [0, 1]. We then show that applying belief propagation-a well-known \message-passing\"" technique for estimating marginal probabilities-to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (p = 1) to standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at the other extreme (p = 0). Configurations in these MRFs have a natural interpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order can be defined. We isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering, which are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with positive probability in the MRF for p = 1. Our experimental results for k = 3 suggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial cores. This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial assignments for p < 1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very close to being cores. To that end, we investigate the associated lattice structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any MRF with p > 0 can be viewed as a \""smoothed\"" version of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments (p = 0). Finally, we isolate proper ties of Gibbs sampling and message-passing algorithms that are typical for an ensemble of k-SAT problems."""

This problem is known as Byzantine Agreement (or Generals) and has been the focus of much research. Lamport et al. [1982] showed that in order to achieve Byzantine Agreement in the plain model, more than two thirds of the participating parties must be honest. They further showed that by augmenting the network with a public-key infrastructure for digital signatures, it is possible to obtain protocols that are secure for any number of corrupted parties. The problem in this augmented model is called \authenticated Byzantine Agreement\"". In this article, we consider the question of concurrent, parallel and sequential composition of authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols with a single common setup. We present surprising impossibility results showing that: (1) Authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols that remain secure under parallel or concurrent composition (even for just two executions) and tolerate a third or more corrupted parties, do not exist. (2) Deterministic authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols that run for r rounds and tolerate a third or more corrupted parties, can remain secure for at most 2r - 1 sequential executions. In contrast, we present randomized protocols for authenticated Byzantine Agreement that remain secure under sequential composition, for any polynomial number of executions. We exhibit two such protocols. In the first protocol, an honest majority is required. In the second protocol, any number of parties may be corrupted; however, the complexity of the protocol is in the order of 2(n) center dot n! for n parties. In order to have this polynomial in the security parameter k (used for the signature scheme in the protocol), this requires the overall number of parties to be limited to O(log k/log log k). The above results are achieved due to a new protocol for authenticated Byzantine Generals for three parties that can tolerate any number of faulty parties and composes sequentially. Finally, we show that when the model is further augmented so that in each session, all the participating parties receive a common session identifier that is unique to that session, then any polynomial number of authenticated Byzantine agreement protocols can be concurrently executed, while tolerating any number of corrupted parties."""

The simplicity is demonstrated with a C++ implementation of 50 effective lines of code. The algorithm is called DC3, which stems from the central underlying concept of difference cover. This view leads to a generalized algorithm, DC, that allows a space-efficient implementation and, moreover, supports the choice of a space-time tradeoff. For any v.

Finding optimal ML trees appears to be a very hard computational task, but for tractable cases, ML is the method of choice. In particular, algorithms and heuristics for ML take longer to run than algorithms and heuristics for the second major character based criterion, maximum parsimony (MP). However, while MP has been known to be NP-complete for over 20 years [Foulds and Graham, 1982; Day et al. 1986], such a hardness result for ML has so far eluded researchers in the field. An important work by Tuffley and Steel [1997] proves quantitative relations between the parsimony values of given sequences and the corresponding log likelihood values. However, a direct application of their work would only give an exponential time reduction from MP to ML. Another step in this direction has recently been made by Addario-Berry et al. [2004], who proved that ancestral maximum likelihood (AML) is NP-complete. AML \lies in between\"" the two problems, having some properties of MP and some properties of ML. Still, the AML proof is not directly applicable to the ML problem. We resolve the question, showing that \""regular\"" ML on phylogenetic trees is indeed intractable. Our reduction follows the vertex cover reductions for MP [Day et al. 1986] and AML [Addario-Berry et al. 2004], but its starting point is an approximation version of vertex cover, known as GAP VC. The crux of our work is not the reduction, but its correctness proof. The proof goes through a series of tree modifications, while controlling the likelihood losses at each step, using the bounds of Tuffley and Steel [1997]. The proof can be viewed as correlating the value of any ML solution to an arbitrarily close approximation to vertex cover."""

The algorithm learns how to combine the recommendations of individual experts so that, in the long run, for any fixed sequence of states of the environment, it does as well as the best expert would have done relative to the same sequence. This methodology may not be suitable for situations where the evolution of states of the environment depends on past chosen actions, as is usually the case, for example, in a repeated non-zero-sum game. A general exploration-exploitation experts method is presented along with a proper definition of value. The definition is shown to be adequate in that it both captures the impact of an expert's actions on the environment and is learnable. The new experts method is quite different from previously proposed experts algorithms. It represents a shift from the paradigms of regret minimization and myopic optimization to consideration of the long-term effect of a player's actions on the environment. The importance of this shift is demonstrated by the fact that this algorithm is capable of inducing cooperation in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, whereas previous experts algorithms converge to the suboptimal non-cooperative play. The method is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best available expert. Several variants are analyzed from the viewpoint of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, including explore-then-exploit, polynomially vanishing exploration, constant-frequency exploration, and constant-size exploration phases.

The auctioneer is faced with an online clearing problem of deciding which buy and sell bids to match without knowing what bids will arrive in the future. For maximizing profit, we present a (randomized) online algorithm with a competitive ratio of ln(p(max) - p(min)) + 1, when bids are in a range [p(min), p(max)], which we show is the best possible. A simpler algorithm has a ratio twice this, and can be used even if expiration times are not known. For maximizing the number of trades, we present a simple greedy algorithm that achieves a factor of 2 competitive ratio if no money-losing trades are allowed. We also show that if the online algorithm is allowed to subsidize matches-match money-losing pairs if it has already collected enough money from previous pairs to pay for them-then it can actually be 1-competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm that is not allowed subsidy. That is, for maximizing the number of trades, the ability to subsidize is at least as valuable as knowing the future. We also consider objectives of maximizing buy or sell volume and social welfare. We present all of these results as corollaries of theorems on online matching in an incomplete interval graph. We also consider the issue of incentive compatibility, and develop a nearly optimal incentive-compatible algorithm for maximizing social welfare. For maximizing profit, we show that no incentive-compatible algorithm can achieve a sublinear competitive ratio, even if only one buy bid and one sell bid are alive at a time.

To obtain fast and accurate protein side-chain packing, protein structures are modeled using a geometric neighborhood graph, which can be easily decomposed into smaller blocks. Therefore, the side-chain assignment of the whole protein can be assembled from the assignment of the small blocks. Although we will show that the side-chain packing problem is still NP-hard, we can achieve a tree-decomposition-based globally optimal algorithm with time complexity of O(Nn(rot)(tw+1)) and several polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS), where N is the number of residues contained in the protein, n(rot) the average number of rotamers for each residue, and tw = O(N-2/3 log N) the treewidth of the protein structure graph. Experimental results indicate that after Goldstein dead-end elimination is conducted, n(rot) is very small and tw is equal to 3 or 4 most of the time. Based on the globally optimal algorithm, we developed a protein side-chain assignment program TreePack, which runs up to 90 times faster than SCWRL 3.0, a widely-used side-chain packing program, on some large test proteins in the SCWRL benchmark database and an average of five times faster on all the test proteins in this database.

Specifically, we prove the existence of the following constructs: -Locally testable binary (linear) codes in which k information bits are encoded by a codeword of length k . exp((O) over tilde (root(log k))). This improves over previous results that either yield codewords of exponential length or obtained almost quadratic length codewords for sufficiently large nonbinary alphabet. -PCP systems of almost-linear length for SAT.

In particular: We show that, for any p is an element of (0, 2], one can maintain (using only O (log n/epsilon(2)) words of storage) a sketch C (q) of a point q is an element of l(p)(n) under dynamic updates of its coordinates. The sketch has the property that, given C (q) and C(s), one can estimate parallel to q-s parallel to(p) up to a factor of (1+epsilon) with large probability. This solves the main open problem of Feigenbaum et al. [1999]. We show that the aforementioned sketching approach directly translates into an approximate algorithm that, for a fixed linear mapping A, and given x is an element of R-n and y is an element of R-m, estimates parallel to Ax-y parallel to(p) in O(n+m) time, for any p is an element of (0, 2]. This generalizes an earlier algorithm of Wasserman and Blum (19971 which worked for the case p=2. We obtain another sketch function C' which probabilistically embeds l(1)(n) into a normed space l(1)(m). The embedding guarantees that, if we set m=log(1/delta)(O(1/epsilon)), then for any pair of points q, s is an element of l(1)(n), the distance between q and s does not increase by more than (1+6 epsilon) with constant probability, and it does not decrease by more than (1-epsilon) with probability 1-delta. This is the only known dimensionality reduction theorem for the l(1) norm. In fact, stronger theorems of this type (i.e., that guarantee very low probability of expansion as well as of contraction) cannot exist [Brinkman and Charikar 2003].

Believing that the local shape of proteins is crucial, we take a geometric approach and present a definition of an interface surface formed by two or more proteins as a subset of their Voronoi diagram. The definition deals with the difficult and important problem of specifying interface boundaries by invoking methods used in the alpha shape representation of molecules, the discrete flow on Delaunay simplices to define pockets and reconstruct surfaces, and the assessment of the importance of topological features. We present an algorithm to construct the surface and define a hierarchy that distinguishes core and peripheral regions. This hierarchy is shown to have correlation with hot-spots in protein-protein interactions.

Requests for service arrive one-by-one and every request is represented by two points: one in each metric space. The problem is to move, at every request, one of the two servers to its request-point such that the total distance travelled by the two servers is minimized. The special case in which both metric spaces are the real line is known as the CNN-problem. It has been a well-known open question in on-line optimization if an algorithm with a constant-competitive ratio exists for this problem. We answer this question in the affirmative by providing a constant-competitive algorithm for the generalized two-server problem on any metric space. The basic result in this article is a characterization of competitiveness for metrical service systems that seems much easier to use when looking for a competitive algorithm.

A classical result of mathematical logic asserts that the existential positive formulas are the only first-order formulas (up to logical equivalence) that are preserved under homomorphisms on all structures, finite and infinite. The question of whether the homomorphism-preservation theorem holds for the class of all finite structures resisted solution for a long time. It was eventually shown that, unlike other classical preservation theorems, the homomorphism-preservation theorem does hold in the finite. In this article, we show that the homomorphism-preservation theorem holds also for several restricted classes of finite structures of interest in graph theory and database theory.

The general CSP is known to be NP-complete; however, certain restrictions on a possible form of constraints may affect the complexity and lead to tractable problem classes. There is, therefore, a fundamental research direction, aiming to separate those subclasses of the CSP that are tractable and those which remain NP-complete. Schaefer gave an exhaustive solution of this problem for the CSP on a 2-element domain. In this article, we generalise this result to a classification of the complexity of the CSP on a 3-element domain. The main result states that every subproblem of the CSP is either tractable or NP-complete, and the criterion separating them is that conjectured in Bulatov et al. [2005] and Bulatov and Jeavons [2001b]. We also characterize those subproblems for which standard constraint propagation techniques provide a decision procedure. Finally, we exhibit a polynomial time algorithm which, for a given set of allowed constraints, outputs if this set gives rise to a tractable problem class.

Our results apply to a broad family of graph problems, called bidimensional problems, which includes many domination and problems such as vertex cover, feedback vertex set, minimum maximal matching, dominating set, edge dominating set, disk dimension, and many others restricted to bounded-genus graphs (phrased as bipartite-graph problem). Furthermore, it is fairly straightforward to prove that a problem is bidimensional. In particular, our framework includes, as special cases, all previously known problems to have such subexponential algorithms. Previously, these algorithms applied to planar graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and/or map graphs; we extend these results to apply to bounded-genus graphs as well. In a parallel development of combinatorial results, we establish an upper bound on the treewidth (or branchwidth) of a bounded-genus graph that excludes some planar graph H as a minor. This bound depends linearly on the size vertical bar V(H)vertical bar of the excluded graph H and the genus g(G) of the graph G, and applies and extends the graph-minors work of Robertson and Seymour. Building on these results, we develop subexponential fixed-parameter algorithms for dominating set, vertex cover, and set cover in any class of graphs excluding a fixed graph H as a minor. In particular, this general category of graphs includes planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and any class of graphs that is closed under taking minors. Specifically, the running time is 2(O(root k))n(h), where h is a constant depending only on H, which is polynomial for k = O(log(2) n). We introduce a general approach for developing algorithms on H-minor-free graphs, based on structural results about H-minor-free graphs at the heart of Robertson and Seymour's graph-minors work. We believe this approach opens the way to further development on problems in H-minor-free graphs."

This article formulates representation independence for classes, in an imperative, object-oriented language with pointers, subclassing and dynamic dispatch, class oriented visibility control, recursive types and methods, and a simple form of module. An instance of a class is considered to implement an abstraction using private fields and so-called representation objects. Encapsulation of representation objects is expressed by a restriction, called confinement, on aliasing. Representation independence is proved for programs satisfying the confinement condition.

Determining whether such dimension reduction is possible in l(1) has been an intriguing open question. We show strong lower bounds for general dimension reduction in l(1). We give an explicit family of n points in l(1) such that any embedding with constant distortion D requires n(Omega(1/D2)) dimensions. This proves that there is no analog of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma for l(1); in fact, embedding with any constant distortion requires n(Omega(1)) dimensions. Further, embedding the points into l(1) with (1 + epsilon) distortion requires n(1/2-O(epsilon log(1/epsilon))) dimensions.

In this article, we consider a wireless system in which the channel conditions and data arrival processes are governed by an adversary. We first consider a single server and a set of users. At each time step t, the server can only transmit data to one user. If user i is chosen, the transmission rate is r(i)(t). We say that the system is (w, epsilon)-admissible if in any window of w time steps the adversary can schedule the users so that the total data arriving to each user is at most 1 - epsilon times the total service it receives. Our objective is to design online scheduling algorithms to ensure stability in an admissible system. We first show, somewhat surprisingly, that the admissibility condition alone does not guarantee the existence of a stable online algorithm, even in a subcritical system (i.e., epsilon > 0). For example, if the nonzero rates in an infinite rate set can be arbitrarily small, then a subcritical system can be unstable for any deterministic online algorithm. On a positive note, we present a tracking algorithm that attempts to mimic the behavior of the adversary. This algorithm ensures stability for all (w, epsilon)-admissible systems that are not excluded by our instability results. As a special case, if the rate set is finite, then the tracking algorithm is stable even for a critical system (i.e., epsilon = 0). Moreover, the queue sizes are independent of epsilon. For subcritical systems, we also show that a simpler max weight algorithm is stable as long as the user rates are bounded away from zero. The offline version of our problem resembles the problem of scheduling unrelated machines and can be modeled by an integer program. We present a rounding algorithm for its linear relaxation and prove that the rounding technique cannot be substantially improved."

Therefore, it provides optimal output-sensitive query time using o(n log n) bits in the worst case. This second data structure builds upon the first one and exploits the interplay between two compressors: the Burrows-Wheeler Transform and the LZ78 algorithm."

We assume an adversary that controls the injection time, source, and destination for each packet injected. A set of paths for these packets is admissible if no link in the network is overloaded. We present the first on-line routing algorithm that finds a set of admissible paths whenever this is feasible. Our algorithm calculates a path for each packet as soon as it is injected at its source using a simple shortest path computation. The length of a link reflects its current congestion. We also show how our algorithm can be implemented under today's Internet routing paradigms. When the paths are known (either given by the adversary or computed as above), our goal is to schedule the packets along the given paths so that the packets experience small end-to-end delays. The best previous delay bounds for deterministic and distributed scheduling protocols were exponential in the path length. In this article, we present the first deterministic and distributed scheduling protocol that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every packet. Finally, we discuss the effects of combining routing with scheduling. We first show that some unstable scheduling protocols remain unstable no matter how the paths are chosen. However, the freedom to choose paths can make a difference. For example, we show that a ring with parallel links is stable for all greedy scheduling protocols if paths are chosen intelligently, whereas this is not the case if the adversary specifies the paths."

By Hall's theorem, one can represent such a multigraph as a combination of at most n(2) cycle covers, each taken with an appropriate multiplicity. We prove that if the d-regular multigraph does not contain more than [d/2] copies of any 2-cycle then we can find a similar decomposition into n(2) pairs of cycle covers where each 2-cycle occurs in at most one component of each pair. Our proof is constructive and gives a polynomial algorithm to find such a decomposition. Since our applications only need one such a pair of cycle covers whose weight is at least the average weight of all pairs, we also give an alternative, simpler algorithm to extract a single such pair. This combinatorial theorem then comes handy in rounding a fractional solution of an LP relaxation of the maximum Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) problem. The first stage of the rounding procedure obtains two cycle covers that do not share a 2-cycle with weight at least twice the weight of the optimal solution. Then we show how to extract a tour from the 2 cycle covers, whose weight is at least 2/3 of the weight of the longest tour. This improves upon the previous 5/8 approximation with a simpler algorithm. Utilizing a reduction from maximum TSP to the shortest superstring problem, we obtain a 2.5 -approximation algorithm for the latter problem, which is again much simpler than the previous one. For minimum asymmetric TSP, the same technique gives two cycle covers, not sharing a 2-cycle, with weight at most twice the weight of the optimum. Assuming triangle inequality, we then show how to obtain from this pair of cycle covers a tour whose weight is at most 0.842 log(2) n larger than optimal. This improves upon a previous approximation algorithm with approximation guarantee of 0-999 log(2) n. Other applications of the rounding procedure are approximation algorithms for maximum 3-cycle cover (factor 2/3, previously 3/5) and maximum asymmetric TSP with triangle inequality (factor 10/13, previously 3/4)."

Qualitatively, it takes a good compression algorithm and turns it into an algorithm with a better compression performance guarantee. It displays the following remarkable properties: (a) it can turn any memoryless compressor into a compression algorithm that uses the \best possible\"" contexts; (b) it is very simple and optimal in terms of time; and (c) it admits a decompression algorithm again optimal in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first boosting technique' displaying these properties. Technically, our boosting technique builds upon three main ingredients: the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, the Suffix Tree data structure, and a greedy algorithm to process them. Specifically, we show that there exists a proper partition of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform of a string s that shows a deep combinatorial relation with the kth order entropy of s. That partition can be identified via a greedy processing of the suffix tree of s with the aim of minimizing a proper objective function over its nodes. The final compressed string is then obtained by compressing individually each substring of the partition by means of the base compressor we wish to boost. Our boosting technique is inherently combinatorial because it does not need to assume any prior probabilistic model about the source emitting s, and it does not deploy any training, parameter estimation and learning. Various corollaries are derived from this main achievement. Among the others, we show analytically that using our booster, we get better compression algorithms than some ;of the best existing ones, that is, LZ77, LZ78, PPMC and the ones derived from the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Further, we settle analytically some long-standing open problems about the algorithmic structure and the performance of BWT-based compressors.

(Min-entropy is a measure of the amount of randomness in a distribution.) We present a simple, self-contained extractor construction that produces good extractors for all min-entropies. Our construction is algebraic and builds on a new polynomial-based approach introduced by Ta-Shma et al. [2001 b]. Using our improvements, we obtain, for example, an extractor with output length m = k/(log n)(O(1/alpha)) and seed length (1 + alpha) log n for an arbitrary 0 < alpha <= 1, where n is the input length, and k is the min-entropy of the input distribution. A \""pseudorandom generator\"" is an algorithm that given a short random seed produces a long output that is computationally indistinguishable from uniform. Our technique also gives a new way to construct pseudorandom generators from functions that require large circuits. Our pseudorandom generator construction is not based on the Nisan-Wigderson generator [Nisan and Wigderson 1994], and turns worst-case hardness directly into pseudorandomness. The parameters of our generator match those in Impagliazzo and Wigderson [1997] and Sudan et al. [2001] and in particular are strong enough to obtain a new proof that P = BPP if E requires exponential size circuits. Our construction also gives the following improvements over previous work: We construct an optimal \""hitting set generator\"" that stretches O(log n) random bits into s(Omega(1)) pseudorandom bits when given a function on log n bits that requires circuits of size s. This yields a quantitatively optimal hardness versus randomness tradeoff for both RP and BPP and solves an open problem raised in Impagliazzo et al. [1999]. We give the first construction of pseudorandom generators that fool nondeteministic circuits when given a function that requires large nondeterministic circuits. This technique also give a quantitatively optimal hardness versus randomness tradeoff for AM and the first hardness amplification result for nondeterministic circuits."""

An important consideration for such schemes is the number of packet header bits that need to be allocated to the marking protocol. Let b denote this value. All previous schemes belong to a class of protocols for which b must be at least log n, where n is the number of bits used to represent the path of the packets. In this article, we introduce a new marking technique for tracing a sequence of packets sent along the same path. This new technique is effective even when b = 1. In other words, the sequence of packets can be traced back to their source using only a single bit in the packet header. With this scheme, the number of packets required to reconstruct the path is O(2(2n)), but we also show that Omega(2(n)) packets are required for any protocol where b = 1. We also study the trade-off between b and the number of packets required. We provide a protocol and a lower bound that together demonstrate that for the optimal protocol, the number of packets required (roughly) increases exponentially with it, but decreases doubly exponentially with b. The protocol we introduce is simple enough to be useful in practice. We also study the case where the packets are sent along k different paths. For this case, we demonstrate that any protocol must use at least log(2k - 1) header bits. We also provide a protocol that requires [log(2k + 1)] header bits in some restricted scenarios.

We first test this measure in the relational context, providing information-theoretic justification for familiar normal forms such as BCNF, 4NF, PJ/NF, 5NFR, DK/NF. We then show that the same measure applies in the XML context, which gives us a characterization of a recently introduced XML normal form called XNF. Finally, we look at information-theoretic criteria for justifying normalization algorithms."

Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches. In many settings, such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts, new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most \interesting\"" to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network. For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip mechanisms, called spatial gossip, that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance d, with high probability, in O(log(1+epsilon) d) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. [1987]. We further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly learn of the nearest copy of a resource in a network. This problem, which is of considerable practical importance, can be solved by a very simple protocol using Spatial Gossip, whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly-logarithmic time. The analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip, namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes."""

A key requirement is that the wrapper generation process should be automated to the largest extent, in order to allow for large-scale extraction tasks even in presence of changes in the underlying sites. So far, however, only semi-automatic proposals have appeared in the literature. We present a novel approach to information extraction from websites, which reconciles recent proposals for supervised wrapper induction with the more traditional field of grammar inference. Grammar inference provides a promising theoretical framework for the study of unsupervised-that is, fully automatic-wrapper generation algorithms. However, due to some unrealistic assumptions on the input, these algorithms are not practically applicable to Web information extraction tasks. The main contributions of the article stand in the definition of a class of regular languages, called the prefix mark-up languages, that abstract the structures usually found in HTML pages, and in the definition of a polynomial-time unsupervised learning algorithm for this class. The article shows that, differently from other known classes, prefix mark-up languages and the associated algorithm can be practically used for information extraction purposes.

Realistic aspects of the problem of synchronizing clocks in the presence of faults are considered. One aspect is that clock synchronization is an on-going task, thus the assumption that some of the processors never fail is too optimistic. To cope with this reality, we suggest self-stabilizing protocols that stabilize in any (long enough) period in which less than a third of the processors are faulty. Another aspect is that the clock value of each processor is bounded. A single transient fault may cause the clock to reach the upper bound. Therefore, we suggest a bounded clock that wraps around when appropriate. We present two randomized self-stabilizing protocols for synchronizing bounded clocks in the presence of Byzantine processor failures. The first protocol assumes that processors have a common pulse, while the second protocol does not. A new type of distributed counter based on the Chinese remainder theorem is used as part of the first protocol."

However, in a shared memory multiprocessor several processes independently and simultaneously submit reads and writes resulting in a partial order of memory operations. In this partial order, the definition of most recent write may be ambiguous. Memory consistency models have been developed to specify what values may be returned by a read given that memory operations may only be partially ordered. Before this work, consistency models were defined independently. Each model followed a set of rules which was separate from the rules of every other model. In our work, we have defined a set of four consistency properties. Any subset of the four properties yields a set of rules which constitute a consistency model. Every consistency model previously described in the literature can be defined based on our four properties. Therefore, we present these properties as a untied theory of shared memory consistency. Our unified theory provides several benefits. First, we claim that these four properties capture the underlying structure of memory consistency. That is, the goal of memory consistency is to ensure certain declarative properties which can be intuitively understood by a programmer, and hence allow him or her to write a correct program. Our unified theory provides a uniform, formal definition of all previously described consistency models, and in addition some combinations of properties produce new models that have not yet been described. We believe these new models will prove to be useful because they are based on declarative properties which programmers desire to be enforced. Finally, we introduce the idea of selecting a consistency model as an on-line activity. Before our work, a shared memory program would run start to finish under a single consistency model. Our unified theory allows the consistency model to change as the program runs while maintaining a consistent definition of what values may be returned by each read."

A widely used measure for the responsiveness of the system is the average flow time of the jobs, that is, the average time spent by jobs in the system between release and completion. The Windows NT and the Unix operating system scheduling policies are based on the Multilevel Feedback algorithm. In this article, we prove that a randomized version of the Multilevel Feedback algorithm is competitive for single and parallel machine systems, in our opinion providing one theoretical validation of the goodness of an idea that has proven effective in practice along the last two decades. The randomized Multilevel Feedback algorithm (RMLF) was first proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs for a single machine achieving an O(log n log log n) competitive ratio to minimize the average flow time against the on-line adaptive adversary, where n is the number of jobs that are released. We present a version of RMLF working for any number m of parallel machines. We show for RMLF a first O(log n log L) competitiveness result against the oblivious adversary on parallel machines. We also show that the same RMLF algorithm surprisingly achieves a tight O(log n) competitive ratio against the oblivious adversary on a single machine, therefore matching the lower bound for this case."

A closed curve composed of two subarcs of distinct pseudo-circles is said to be an empty lens if the closed Jordan region that it bounds does not intersect any other member of the family. We establish a linear upper bound on the number of empty lenses in an arrangement of n pseudo-circles with the property that any two curves intersect precisely twice. We use this bound to show that any collection of n x-monotone pseudo-circles can be cut into O(n(8/5)) arcs so that any two intersect at most once; this improves a previous bound of 0(n(5/3)) due to Tamaki and Tokuyama. If, in addition, the given collection admits an algebraic representation by three real parameters that satisfies some simple conditions, then the number of cuts can be further reduced to O(n(3/1)(log n)O-(alphas(n))), where alpha(n) is the inverse Ackermarm function, and s is a constant that depends on the the representation of the pseudo-circles. For arbitrary collections of pseudo-circles, any two of which intersect exactly twice, the number of necessary cuts reduces still further to 0(n(4/3)). As applications, we obtain improved bounds for the number of incidences, the complexity of a single level, and the complexity of many faces in arrangements of circles, of pairwise intersecting pseudo-circles, of arbitrary x-monotone pseudo-circles, of parabolas, and of homothetic copies of any fixed simply shaped convex curve. We also obtain a variant of the Gallai-Sylvester theorem for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudo-circles, and a new lower bound on the number of distinct distances under any well-behaved norm."

Moreover, we prove that blocks of O (log log N) bits of x are computationally indistinguishable from random bits. The results carry over to the Rabin encryption scheme. Considering the discrete exponentiation function g(x) modulo p, with probability 1 - o(1) over random choices of the prime p, the analog results are demonstrated.

Finally, we prove that the bits of ax + b modulo p give hard core predicates for any one-way function f.

In this article, we study the complexity of evaluating existential second-order formulas that belong to prefix classses of existential second-order logic, where a prefix class is the collection of all existential second-order formulas in prenex normal form such that the second-order and the first-order quantifiers obey a certain quantifier pattern. We completely characterize the computational complexity of prefix classes of existential second-order logic in three different contexts: (1) over directed graphs, (2) over undirected graphs with self-loops and (3) over undirected graphs without self-loops. Our main result is that in each of these three contexts a dichotomy holds, that is to say, each prefix class of existential second-order logic either contains sentences that can express NP-complete problems, or each of its sentences expresses a polynomial-time solvable problem. Although the boundary of the dichotomy coincides for the first two cases, it changes, as one moves to undirected graphs without self-loops. The key difference is that a certain prefix class, based on the well-known Ackennann class of first-order logic, contains sentences that can express NP-complete problems over graphs of the first two types, but becomes tractable over undirected graphs without self-loops. Moreover, establishing the dichotomy over undirected graphs without self-loops turns out to be a technically challenging problem that requires the use of sophisticated machinery from graph theory and combinatories, including results about graphs of bounded tree-width and Ramsey's theorem."

Given a declustering scheme D, its response time with respect to a query Q, rt(Q), is defined to be the maximum number of data blocks of the query stored by the scheme in any one of the disks. If \Q\ is the number of data blocks in Q and M is the number of disks, then rt(Q) is at least [\Q\/M]. One way to evaluate the performance of D with respect to a set of range queries Q is to measure its additive error-the maximum difference of rt(Q) from [\Q\/M] over all range queries Q is an element of Q. In this article, we consider the problem of designing declustering schemes for uniform multidimensional data arranged in a d-dimensional grid so that their additive errors with respect to range queries are as small as possible. It has been shown that for a fixed dimension d greater than or equal to 2, any declustering scheme on an M-d grid, a grid with length M on each dimension, will always incur an additive error with respect to range queries of Omega(log M) when d = 2 and Omega(log (d-1)(2) M) when d > 2. Asymptotically optimal declustering schemes exist for 2-dimensional data. However, the best general upper bound known so far for the worst-case additive errors of d-dimensional declustering schemes, d greater than or equal to 3, is O(Md-1), which is large when compared to the lower bound. In this article, we propose two declustering schemes based on low-discrepancy points in d-dimensions. When d is fixed, both schemes have an additive error of O(log(d-1) M) with respect to range queries, provided that certain conditions are satisfied: the first scheme requires that the side lengths of the grid grow at a rate polynomial in M, while the second scheme requires d greater than or equal to 2 and M = p(t) where d less than or equal to p less than or equal to C, C a constant, and t is a positive integer such that t(d - 1) greater than or equal to 2.

We provide a new theory that unifies previous experimental observations on partitioning and heuristic observations on column permutation, all of which are used to improve compression rates. Based on this theory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression, which can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating sources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by rearranging columns prior to partitioning. We demonstrate these results experimentally. On various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55% improvement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering provides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone.

(2) The power of 3-round weak zero-knowledge arguments. The question is what can be proved in (a possibly weakened form of) zero-knowledge in a 3-round argument. In particular, is there a language outside of BPP that has a 3-round public-coin weak zero-knowledge argument? (3) The Fiat-Shamir methodology. This is a method for converting a 3-round public-coin argument (viewed as an identification scheme) to a 1-round signature scheme. The method requires what we call a \magic function\"" that the signer applies to the first-round message of the argument to obtain a second-round message (queries from the verifier). An open question here is whether every 3-round public-coin argument for a language outside of BPP has a magic function. It follows easily from definitions that if a 3-round public-coin argument system is zero-knowledge in the standard (fairly strong) sense, then it has no magic function. We define a weakening of zero-knowledge such that zero-knowledge double right arrow no-magic-function still holds. For this weakened form of zero-knowledge, we give a partial converse: informally, if a 3-round public-coin argument system is not weakly zero-knowledge, then some form of magic is possible for this argument system. We obtain our definition of weak zero-knowledge by a sequence of weakenings of the standard definition, forming a hierarchy. Intermediate forms of zero-knowledge in this hierarchy are reasonable ones, and they may be useful in applications. Finally, we relate the selective decommitment problem to public-coin proof systems and arguments at an intermediate level of the hierarchy, and obtain several positive security results for selective decommitment."""

The approach studies conditions that identify sets of input vectors for which it is possible to solve consensus despite the occurrence of up to f process crashes. The first main result defines acceptable conditions and shows that these are exactly the conditions for which a consensus protocol exists. Two examples of realistic acceptable conditions are presented, and proved to be maximal, in the sense that they cannot be extended and remain acceptable. The second main result is a generic consensus shared-memory protocol for any acceptable condition. The protocol always guarantees agreement and validity, and terminates (at least) when the inputs satisfy the condition with which the protocol has been instantiated, or when there are no crashes. An efficient version of the protocol is then designed for the message passing model that works when f < n/2, and it is shown that no such protocol exists when f greater than or equal to n/2. It is also shown how the protocol's safety can be traded for its liveness."

We show that for any polyhedral norm, the problem of finding a tour of maximum length can be solved in polynomial time. If arithmetic operations are assumed to take unit time, our algorithms run in time 0(n(f-2) log n), where f is the number of facets of the polyhedron determining the polyhedral norm. Thus, for example, we have 0(n(2) log n) algorithms for the cases of points in the plane under the Rectilinear and Sup norrns. This is in contrast to the fact that finding a minimum length tour in each case is NP-hard. Our approach can be extended to the more general case of quasi-norms with a not necessarily symmetric unit ball, where we get a complexity of 0(n(2f-2) log n). For the special case of two-dimensional metrics with f = 4 (which includes the Rectilinear and Sup norms), we present a simple algorithm with 0(n) running time. The algorithm does not use any indirect addressing, so its running time remains valid even in comparison based, models in which sorting requires Omega(n log n) time. The basic mechanism of the algorithm provides some intuition on why polyhedral norms allow fast algorithms. Complementing the results on simplicity for polyhedral norms, we prove that, for the case of Euclidean distances in R-d for d greater than or equal to 3, the Maximum TSP is NP-hard. This sheds new light on the well-studied difficulties of Euclidean distances."

These form an algebra-a class of n-ary relations for every n, closed under projection and Boolean operations. We show that by choosing the string vocabulary carefully, we get string logics that have desirable properties: computable evaluation and normal forms. We identify five distinct models and study the differences in their model-theory and complexity of evaluation. We identify a subset of these models that have additional attractive properties, such as finite VC dimension and quantifier elimination. Once you have a logic, the addition of free predicate symbols gives you a string query language. The resulting languages have attractive closure properties from a database point of view: while SQL does not allow the full composition of string pattern-matching expressions with relational operators, these logics yield compositional query languages that can capture common string-matching queries while remaining tractable. For each of the logics studied in the first part of the article, we study properties of the corresponding query languages.

Thus, we demonstrate that the set of problems learnable in the statistical query model is a strict subset of those problems learnable in the presence of noise in the PAC model. In coding-theory terms, what we give is a poly(n)-time algorithm for decoding linear k x n codes in the presence of random noise for the case of k = c log n log log it for some c > 0. (The case of k = O(log n) is trivial since one can just individually check each of the 2(k) possible messages and choose the one that yields the closest codeword.)

The second result of this article is to show that any class of functions learnable (strongly or weakly) with t-wise queries for t = O(log n) is also weakly learnable with standard unary queries.

These latter switching architectures require a scheduling algorithm to select at each slot a subset of input-buffered cells that can be transferred toward Output ports. Although the stability proper-ties (i.e., the limit throughput) of IQ and CIOQ cell-based switches were already studied for several classes of scheduling algorithms, very few analytical results concerning cell delays or queue lengths are available in the technical literature.

We consider multiple-choice algorithms that choose d locations (bins) for each ball at random, inspect the content of these locations, and then place the ball into one of them, for example, in a location with minimum number of balls. The goal is to achieve a good load balancing. This objective is measured in terms of the maximum load, that is, the maximum number of balls in the same bin. Multiple-choice algorithms have been studied extensively in the past. Previous analyses typically assume that the d locations for each ball are drawn uniformly and independently from the set of all bins. We investigate whether a nonuniform or dependent selection of the d locations of a ball may lead to a better load balancing. Three types of selection, resulting in three classes of algorithms, are distinguished: (1) uniform and independent, (2) nonuniform and independent, and (3) nonuniform and dependent. Our first result shows that the well-studied uniform greedy algorithm (class 1) does not obtain the smallest possible maximum load. In particular, we introduce a nonuniform algorithm (class 2) that obtains a better load balancing. Surprisingly, this algorithm uses an unfair tie-breaking mechanism, called Always-Go-Left, resulting in an asymmetric assignment of the balls to the bins. Our second result is a lower bound showing that a dependent allocation (class 3) cannot yield significant further improvement. Our upper and lower bounds on the maximum load are tight up to additive constants, proving that the Always-Go-Left algorithm achieves an almost optimal load balancing among all sequential multiple-choice algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the results for the Always-Go-Left algorithm can be generalized to allocation processes with more balls than bins and even to infinite processes in which balls are inserted and deleted by an oblivious adversary."

The key step in converting a program to SSA form is called phi-placement. Many algorithms for phi-placement have been proposed in the literature, but the relationships between these algorithms are not well understood. In this article, we propose a framework within which we systematically derive (i) properties of the SSA form and (ii) phi-placement algorithms. This framework is based on a new relation called merge which captures succinctly the structure of a program's control flow graph that is relevant to its SSA form. The phi-placement algorithms we derive include most of the ones described in the literature, as well as several new ones. We also evaluate experimentally the performance of some of these algorithms on the SPEC92 benchmarks. Some of the algorithms described here are optimal for a single variable. However, their repeated application is not necessarily optimal for multiple variables. We conclude the article by describing such an optimal algorithm, based on the transitive reduction of the merge relation, for multi-variable phi-placement in structured programs.

The mini-bucket approach to optimization problems, such as finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks, generates both an approximate solution and bounds on the solution quality.

The bounds hold even in the case that the computation is allowed to have arbitrary probability of error on a small fraction of inputs. Our techniques are extension of those used by Ajtai and by Beame, Jayram, and Saks that applied to deterministic branching programs. Our results also give a quantitative improvement over the previous results. Previous time-space trade-off results for decision problems can be divided naturally into results for functions with Boolean domain, that is, each input variable is {0, 1}-valued, and the case of large domain, where each input variable takes on values from a set whose size grows with the number of variables. In the case of Boolean domain, Ajtai exhibited an explicit class of functions, and proved that any deterministic Boolean branching program or RAM using space S = o(n) requires superlinear time T to compute them. The functional form of the superlinear bound is not given in his paper, but optimizing the parameters in his arguments gives T = Omega(n log log n/log log log n) for S = 0(n(1-epsilon)). For the same functions considered by Ajtai, we prove a time-space trade-off (for randomized branching programs with error) of the form T = Omega(nrootlog(n/S)/log log(n/S)). In particular, for space O(n(1-epsilon)), this improves the lower bound on time to Omega(nrootlog n/log log n). In the large domain case, we prove lower bounds of the form T = Omega(nrootlog(n/S)/log log(n/S)) for randomized computation of the element distinctness function and lower bounds of the form T = Omega(n log(n/S)) for randomized computation of Ajtai's Hamming closeness problem and of certain functions,associated with quadratic forms over large fields."

The necessary and sufficient conditions relax the requirements for deadlock-free routing, compared to techniques that provide only a sufficient condition. These necessary and sufficient conditions can be applied in a straightforward manner to prove deadlock freedom of newly developed adaptive routing algorithms for collective communication, which in turn will help in developing efficient and correct routing algorithms.

We systematically study these methods. In the first part of the article, we consider arbitrary formulas on tree-like structures. We generalize a theorem of Courcelle [1990] by showing that on structures of bounded tree-width a monadic second-order formula (with free first- and second-order variables) can be evaluated in time linear in the structure size plus the size of the output. In the second part, we study tree-like formulas on arbitrary structures. We generalize the notions of acyclicity and bounded tree-width from conjunctive queries to arbitrary first-order formulas in a straightforward way and analyze the complexity of evaluating formulas of these fragments.

As a corollary, we obtain cache-efficient algorithms in the single-level cache model for fundamental problems like sorting, FFT, and an important subclass of permutations. We also analyze the average-case cache behavior of mergesort, show that ignoring associativity concerns could lead to inferior performance, and present supporting experimental evidence. We further extend our model to multiple levels of cache with limited associativity and present optimal algorithms for matrix transpose and sorting.

This is true of mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumed practical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorial auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of these mechanisms-in particular, their truth revelation properties-assumes that the optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimization problems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigate the impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones. Specifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method. We show that the GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. We introduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restricted class of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying natural properties for combinatorial auctions and showing that, for our restricted class of players, they imply that truthful strategies are dominant. Those properties have applicability beyond the specific auction studied."

The method was originally developed as a key component of the compartmentalized assembly strategy developed at Celera Genomics.

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry, and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks to find a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two \related\"" objects. We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem. We provide the first nontrivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O (log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric-all distances are the same-our methods provide a 2-approximation algorithm."""

We introduce a third, more general variety of temporal logic: alternating-time temporal logic offers selective quantification over those paths that are possible outcomes of games, such as the game in which the system and the environment alternate moves. While linear-time and branching-time logics are natural specification languages for closed systems, alternating-time logics are natural specification languages for open systems. For example, by preceding the temporal operator \eventually\"" with a selective path quantifier, we can specify that in the game between the system and the environment, the system has a strategy to reach a certain state. The problems of receptiveness, realizability, and controllability can be formulated as model-checking problems for alternating-time formulas. Depending on whether or not we admit arbitrary nesting of selective path quantifiers and temporal operators, we obtain the two alternating-time temporal logics ATL and ATL*. ATL and ATL* are interpreted over concurrent game structures. Every state transition of a concurrent game structure results from a choice of moves, one for each player. The players represent individual components and the environment of an open system. Concurrent game structures can capture various forms of synchronous composition for open systems, and if augmented with fairness constraints, also asynchronous composition. Over structures without fairness constraints, the model-checking complexity of ATL is linear in the size of the game structure and length of the formula, and the symbolic model-checking algorithm for CTL extends with few modifications to ATL. Over structures with weak-fairness constraints, ATL model checking requires the solution of 1-pair Rabin games, and can be done in polynomial time. Over structures with strong-fairness constraints, ATL model checking requires the solution of games with Boolean combinations of Buchi conditions, and can be done in PSPACE. In the case of ATL*, the model-checking problem is closely related to the synthesis problem for linear-time formulas, and requires doubly exponential time."""

Contrary to classical approaches to decision theory, we try to rank acts without resorting to any numerical representation of utility or uncertainty, and without using any scale on which both uncertainty and preference could be mapped. Our approach is a variant of Savage's where the setting is finite, and the strict preference on acts is a partial order. It is shown that although many axioms of Savage theory are preserved and despite the intuitive appeal of the ordinal method for constructing a preference over acts, the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The latter leads to the kind of paradoxes encountered in the theory of voting. It is shown that the assumption of ordinal invariance enforces a qualitative decision procedure that presupposes a comparative possibility representation of uncertainty, originally due to Lewis, and usual in nonmonotonic reasoning. Our axiomatic investigation thus provides decision-theoretic foundations to the preferential inference of Lehmann and colleagues. However, the obtained decision rules are sometimes either not very decisive or may lead to overconfident decisions, although their basic principles look sound. This paper points out some limitations of purely ordinal approaches to Savage-like decision making under uncertainty, in perfect analogy with similar difficulties in voting theory."

We show that nontrivial quantum codes exist that have no classical counterparts. On the other hand, we show that quantum encoding cannot save more than a logarithmic additive factor over the best classical encoding. The proof is based on an entropy coalescence principle that is obtained by viewing Holevo's theorem from a new perspective. In the existing implementations of quantum computing, qubits are a very expensive resource. Moreover, it is difficult to reinitialize existing bits during the computation. In particular, remitialization is impossible in NMR quantum computing, which is perhaps the most advanced implementation of quantum computing at the moment. This motivates the study of quantum computation with restricted memory and no reinitialization, that is, of quantum finite automata. It was known that there are languages that are recognized by quantum finite automata with sizes exponentially smaller than those of corresponding classical automata.

Both algorithms use fast matrix multiplication algorithms. The first algorithm solves the APSP problem for weighted directed graphs in which the edge weights are integers of small absolute value in (O) over tilde (n(2+mu)) time, where mu satisfies the equation omega(1, mu, 1) = 1 + 2mu and omega(1, mu, 1) is the exponent of the multiplication of an n x n(mu) matrix by an n(mu) x n matrix. Currently, the best available bounds on omega(1, mu, 1), obtained by Coppersmith, imply that mu < 0.575. The running time of our algorithm is therefore O(n(2.575)). Our algorithm improves on the (O) over tilde (n((3+omega)/2)) time algorithm, where omega = omega(1, 1, 1) < 2.376 is the usual exponent of matrix multiplication, obtained by Alon et al., whose running time is only known to be O(n(2.688)). The second algorithm solves the APSP problem almost exactly for directed graphs with arbitrary nonnegative real weights. The algorithm runs in O((n(omega)/epsilon) log(W/epsilon)) time, where epsilon > 0 is an error parameter and TV is the largest edge weight in the graph, after the edge weights are scaled so that the smallest non-zero edge weight in the graph is 1. It returns estimates of all the distances in the graph with a stretch of at most 1 + epsilon. Corresponding paths can also be found efficiently."

This result appears paradoxical, because by adding communication capacity to the system for the sharing of jobs between nodes, the overall system performance is degraded. We characterize conditions under which such paradoxical behavior occurs, and we give examples in which the degradation of performance may increase without bound.

We show that similar (though weaker) properties hold for certain random linear transformations over the Hamming cube. We use these transformations to solve NP-hard clustering problems in the cube as well as in geometric settings. More specifically, we address the following clustering problem. Given n points in a larger set (e.g., R-d) endowed with a distance function (e.g., L-2 distance), we would like to partition the data set into k disjoint clusters, each with a \cluster center,\"" so as to minimize the sum over all data points of the distance between the point and the center of the cluster containing the point. The problem is provably NP-hard in some high-dimensional geometric settings, even for k = 2. We give polynomial-time approximation schemes for this problem in several settings, including the binary cube {0, 1}(d) with Hamming distance, and R-d either with L-1 distance, or with L-2 distance, or with the square of L-2 distance. In all these settings, the best previous results were constant factor approximation guarantees. We note that our problem is similar in flavor to the k-median problem (and the related facility location problem), which has been considered in graph-theoretic and fixed dimensional geometric settings, where it becomes hard when k is part of the input. In contrast, we study the problem when k is fixed, but the dimension is part of the input."""

This problem has two versions: the Closest String problem and the Closest Substring problem. Given a set of strings S = {s(1), s(2),..., s(n)}, each of length m, the Closest String problem is to find the smallest d and a string s of length m which is within Hamming distance d to each s(i) is an element of S. This problem comes from coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from a given set of codes. Closest Substring problem, with an additional input integer L, asks for the smallest d and a string s, of length L, which is within Hamming distance d away from a substring, of length L, of each s(i). This problem is much more elusive than the Closest String problem. The Closest Substring problem is formulated from applications in finding conserved regions, identifying genetic drug targets and generating genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether there are efficient approximation algorithms for both problems are major open questions in this area. We present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms with approximation ratio 1 + epsilon for any small epsilon to settle both questions."""

We are given a network, a rate of traffic between each pair of nodes, and a latency function for each edge specifying the time needed to traverse the edge given its congestion; the objective is to route traffic such that the sum of all travel times-the total latency-is minimized. In many settings, it may be expensive or impossible to regulate network traffic so as to implement an optimal assignment of routes. In the absence of regulation by some central authority, we assume that each network user routes its traffic on the minimum-latency path available to it, given the network congestion caused by the other users. In general such a \selfishly motivated\"" assignment of traffic to paths will not minimize the total latency; hence, this lack of regulation carries the cost of decreased network performance. In this article, we quantify the degradation in network performance due to unregulated traffic. We prove that if the latency of each edge is a linear function of its congestion, then the total latency of the routes chosen by selfish network users is at most 4/3 times the minimum possible total latency (subject to the condition that all traffic must be routed). We also consider the more general setting in which edge latency functions are assumed only to be continuous and nondecreasing in the edge congestion. Here, the total latency of the routes chosen by unregulated selfish network users may be arbitrarily larger than the minimum possible total latency; however, we prove that it is no more than the total latency incurred by optimally routing twice as much traffic."""

BAGs can express only unary queries; RAGs can express queries of any arity. We first show that the (unary) queries expressible by BAGs are precisely those definable in monadic second-order logic, We then show that the queries expressible by RAGs are precisely those definable by first-order inductions of linear depth, or, equivalently, those computable in linear time on a parallel machine with polynomially many processors. Further, we show that RAGs that only use synthesized attributes are strictly weaker than RAGs that use both synthesized and inherited attributes. We show that RAGs are more expressive than monadic second-order logic for queries of any arity.

A prominent feature of this research trend is its simultaneous but independent materialization within several fields of computer science. The resulting richness of paradigms, methods and systems may, on the long run, result in a fragmentation of efforts and slow down progress. The primary goal of this study is to promote an integration of methods and techniques for MIR by contributing a conceptual model that encompasses in a unified and coherent perspective the many efforts that are being produced Under the label of MIR. The model offers a retrieval capability that spans two media, text and images, but also several dimensions: form, content and structure. In this way, it reconciles similarity-based methods with semantics-based ones, providing the guidelines for the design of systems that are able to provide a generalized multimedia retrieval service, in which the existing forms of retrieval not only coexist, but can be combined in any desired manner. The model is formulated in terms of a fuzzy description logic, which plays a twofold role: (1) it directly models semantics-based retrieval, and (2) it offers an ideal framework for the integration of the multimedia and multidimensional aspects of retrieval mentioned above. The model also accounts for relevance feedback in both text and image retrieval, integrating known techniques for taking into account user judgments. The implementation of the model is addressed by presenting a decomposition technique that reduces query evaluation to the processing of simpler requests, each of which can be solved by means of widely known methods for text and image retrieval, and semantic processing. A prototype for multidimensional image retrieval is presented that shows this decomposition technique at work in a significant case."

According to this approach, the reasoning process is split into two phases: an off-line compilation phase and an on-line query-answering phase. In the off-line phase, the propositional theory is compiled into some target language, which is typically a tractable one. In the on-line phase, the compiled target is used to efficiently answer a (potentially) exponential number of queries. The main motivation behind knowledge compilation is to push as much of the computational overhead as possible into the off-line phase, in order to amortize that overhead over all on-line queries. Another motivation behind compilation is to produce very simple on-line reasoning systems, which can be embedded cost-effectively into primitive computational platforms, such as those found in consumer electronics. One of the key aspects of any compilation approach is the target language into which the propositional theory is compiled. Previous target languages included Horn theories, prime implicates/implicants and ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). We propose in this paper a new target compilation language, known as decomposable negation normal form (DNNF), and present a number of its properties that make it of interest to the broad community. Specifically, we show that DNNF is universal; supports a rich set of polynomial-time logical operations; is more space-efficient than OBDDs; and is very simple as far as its structure and algorithms are concerned. Moreover, we present an algorithm for converting any propositional theory in clausal form into a DNNF and show that if the clausal form has a bounded treewidth, then its DNNF compilation has a linear size and can be computed in linear time (treewidth is a graph-theoretic parameter that measures the connectivity of the clausal form). We also propose two techniques for approximating the DNNF compilation of a theory when the size of such compilation is too large to be practical. One of the techniques generates a sound but incomplete compilation, while the other generates a complete but unsound compilation. Together, these approximations bound the exact compilation from below and above in terms of their ability to answer clausal entailment queries. Finally, we show that the class of polynomial-time DNNF operations is rich enough to support relatively complex AI applications, by proposing a specific framework for compiling model-based diagnosis systems."

This approach is easily seen to generalize other approaches to modeling uncertainty, such as probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures. We focus on one application of plausibility measures in this paper: default reasoning. In recent years, a number of different semantics for defaults have been proposed, such as preferential structures, epsilon-semantics, possibilistic structures, and kappa-rankings, that have been shown to be characterized by the same set of axioms, known as the KLM properties. While this was viewed as a surprise, we show here that it is almost inevitable. In the framework of plausibility measures, we can give a necessary condition for the KLM axioms to be sound, and an additional condition necessary and sufficient to ensure that the KLM axioms are complete. This additional condition is so weak that it is almost always met whenever the axioms are sound. In particular, it is easily seen to hold for all the proposals made in the literature."

In such problems, the objective is to minimize the deviation cost function that depends on the distance between the observed value and the modify value. In Markov random field problems, there is also a pairwise relationship between the objects. The objective in Markov random field problem is to minimize the sum of the deviation cost function and a penalty function that grows with the distance between the values of related pairs-separation function. We discuss Markov random fields problems in the context of a representative application-the image segmentation problem. In this problem, the goal is to modify color shades assigned to pixels of an image so that the penalty function consisting of one term due to the deviation from the initial color shade and a second term that penalizes differences in assigned values to neighboring pixels is minimized. We present here an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time when the deviation function is convex and separation function is linear; and in strongly polynomial time when the deviation cost function is linear, quadratic or piecewise linear convex with few pieces (where \few\"" means a number exponential in a polynomial function of the number of variables and constraints). The complexity of the algorithm for a problem on n pixels or variables, m adjacency relations or constraints, and range of variable values (colors) U, is O(T (n, m) + n log U) where T (n, m) is the complexity of solving the minimum s, t cut problem on a graph with n nodes and m arcs. Furthermore, other algorithms are shown to solve the problem with convex deviation and convex separation in running time O (mn log n log n U) and the problem with nonconvex deviation and convex separation in running time 0(T (n U, m U). The nonconvex separation problem is NP-hard even for fixed value of U.

The primary motivation comes from database applications, where aggregate operators are present in all real life query languages. Unlike other features of query languages, aggregates are not adequately captured by the existing logical formalisms. Consequently, all previous approaches to analyzing the expressive power of aggregation were only capable of producing partial results, depending on the allowed class of aggregate and arithmetic operations. We consider a powerful counting logic, and extend it with the set of all aggregate operators. We show that the resulting logic satisfies analogs of Hanf's and Gaifman's theorems, meaning that it can only express local properties. We consider a database query language that expresses all the standard aggregates found in commercial query languages, and show how it can be translated into the aggregate logic, thereby providing a number of expressivity bounds, that do not depend on a particular class of arithmetic functions, and that subsume all those previously known. We consider a restricted aggregate logic that gives us a tighter capture of database languages, and also use it to show that some questions on expressivity of aggregation cannot be answered without resolving some deep problems in complexity theory."

This paper considers methods that automatically translate algorithms tolerant of simple crash failures into ones tolerant of more severe failures. These translations simplify the design task by allowing algorithm designers to assume that processors fail only by stopping. Such translations can be quantified by two measures: fault-tolerance, which is a measure of how many processors must remain correct for the translation to be correct, and round-complexity, which is a measure of how the translation increases the running time of an algorithm. Understanding these translations and their limitations with respect to these measures can provide insight into the relative impact of different models of faulty behavior on the ability to provide fault-tolerant applications for systems with synchronous message passing. This paper considers translations from crash failures to each of the following types of more severe failures: omission to send messages; omission to send and receive messages; and totally arbitrary behavior. It shows that previously developed translations to send-omission failures are optimal with respect to both fault-tolerance and round-complexity. It exhibits a hierarchy of translations to general (send/receive) omission failures that improves upon the fault-tolerance of previously developed translations. These translations are optimal in that they cannot be improved with respect to one measure without negatively affecting the others that is, the hierarchy of translations is matched by corresponding hierarchy of impossibility results. The paper also gives a hierarchy of translations to arbitrary failures that improves upon the round-complexity of previously developed translations. These translations are near-optimal, the hierarchy is matched by a hierarchy of impossibility results whose fault-tolerances differ from those of the translations only by small constants."

We provide a theoretical model for this problem in which the goal is to send acks at times that minimize a linear combination of the cost for the number of acknowledgments sent and the cost for the additional latency introduced by delaying acknowledgments. To study the usefulness of applying packet arrival time prediction to this problem, we assume there is an oracle that provides the algorithm with the times of the next L arrivals, for some L greater than or equal to 0. We give two different objective functions for measuring the cost of a solution, each with its own measure of latency cost. For each objective function we first give an 0(n(2))-time dynamic programming algorithm for optimally solving the off-line problem. Then we describe an on-line algorithm that greedily acknowledges exactly when the cost for an acknowledgment is less than the latency cost incurred by not acknowledging. We show that for this algorithm there is a sequence of n packet arrivals for which it is Omega (rootn)-competitive for the first objective function, 2-competitive for the second function for L = 0, and 1-competitive for the second function for L = 1. Next we present a second on-line algorithm which is a slight modification of the first, and we prove that it is 2-competitive for both objective functions for all L. We also give lower bounds on the competitive ratio for any deterministic on-line algorithm. These results show that for each objective function, at least one of our algorithms is optimal. Finally, we give some initial empirical results using arrival sequences from real network traffic where we compare the two methods used in TCP for acknowledgment delay with our two on-line algorithms.

We show that certain high probability and worst case bounds on the quasi-static (finite past) performance of a routing algorithm imply bounds on the performance of the dynamic version of that algorithm. Our technique is particularly useful in analyzing routing on networks with bounded buffers where complicated dependencies make standard queuing techniques inapplicable. We present several applications of our approach. In all cases we start from a known static algorithm, and modify it to fit our framework. In particular we give the first dynamic algorithms for routing on a butterfly or two-dimensional mesh with bounded buffers.

We focus on a basic adversarial model of packet arrival and path determination for which the time-averaged arrival rate of packets requiring the use of any edge is limited to be less than 1. This model can reflect the behavior of connection-oriented networks with transient connections (such as ATM networks) as well as connectionless networks (such as the Internet). We concentrate on greedy (also known as work-conserving) contention-resolution protocols. A crucial issue that arises in such a setting is that of stability--will the number of packets in the system remain bounded, as the system runs for an arbitrarily long period of time? We study the universal stability of networks (i.e., stability under all greedy protocols) and universal stability of protocols (i.e., stability in all networks). Once the stability of a system is granted, we focus on the two main parameters that characterize its performance: maximum queue size required and maximum end-to-end delay experienced by any packet. Among other things, we show: (i) There exist simple greedy protocols that are stable for all networks. (ii) There exist other commonly used protocols (such as FIFO) and networks (such as arrays and hypercubes) that are not stable. (iii) The n-node ring is stable for all greedy routing protocols (with maximum queue-size and packet delay that is linear in n). (iv) There exists a simple distributed randomized greedy protocol that is stable for all networks and requires only polynomial queue size and polynomial delay. Our results resolve several questions posed by Borodin et al.. and provide the first examples of (i) a protocol that is stable for all networks, and (ii) a protocol that is not stable for all networks."

We present a recursive technique for building suffix trees that yields optimal algorithms in different computational models. Sorting is an inherent bottleneck in building suffix trees and our algorithms match the sorting lower bound. Specifically, we present the following results. (1) Weiner [1973], who introduced the data structure, gave an optimal O(n)-time algorithm for building the suffix tree of an n-character string drawn from a constant-size alphabet. In the comparison model, there is a trivial n(n log n)-time lower bound based on sorting, and Weiner's algorithm matches this bound. For integer alphabets, the fastest known algorithm is the O(n log n) time comparison-based algorithm, but no super-linear lower bound is known. Closing this gap is the main open question in stringology. We settle this open problem by giving a linear time reduction to sorting for building suffix trees. Since sorting is a lower-bound for building suffix trees, this algorithm is time-optimal in every alphabet model, in particular, for an alphabet consisting of integers in a polynomial range we get the first known linear-time algorithm. (2) All previously known algorithms for building suffix trees exhibit a marked absence of locality of reference, and thus they tend to elicit many page faults (I/Os) when indexing very long strings. They are therefore unsuitable for building suffix trees in secondary storage devices, where I/Os dominate the overall computational cost. We give a linear-I/O reduction to sorting for suffix tree construction. Since sorting is a trivial I/O-lower bound for building suffix trees, our algorithm is I/O-optimal."

The data structure supports the usual operations: insert, delete, meld, and findmin. Its novelty is to beat the logarithmic bound on the complexity of a heap in a comparison-based model. To break this information-theoretic barrier, the entropy of the data structure is reduced by artificially raising the values of certain keys. Given any mixed sequence of n operations, a soft heap with error rate epsilon (for any 0 < <epsilon> less than or equal to 1/2) ensures that, at any time, at most En of its items have their keys raised. The amortized complexity of each operation is constant, except for insert, which takes O(log 1/epsilon) time. The soft heap is optimal for any value of epsilon in a comparison-based model. The data structure is purely pointer-based. No arrays are used and no numeric assumptions are made on the keys. The main idea behind the soft heap is to move items across the data structure not individually, as is customary, but in groups, in a data-structuring equivalent of \car pooling.\"" Keys must be raised as a result, in order to preserve the heap ordering of the data structure.

Its aim is to exploit to the full those aspects of computational learning that are known to offer powerful solutions in the acquisition and maintenance of robust knowledge bases. The architecture makes explicit the requirements on the basic computational tasks that are to be performed and is designed to make these computationally tractable even for very large databases. The main claims are that (i) the basic learning and deduction tasks are provably tractable and (ii) tractable learning offers viable approaches to a range of issues that have been previously identified as problematic for artificial intelligence systems that are programmed. Among the issues that learning offers to resolve are robustness to inconsistencies, robustness to incomplete information and resolving among alternatives. Attribute-efficient learning algorithms, which allow learning from few examples in large dimensional systems, are fundamental to the approach. Underpinning the overall architecture is a new principled approach to manipulating relations in learning systems. This approach, of independently quantified arguments, allows propositional learning algorithms to be applied systematically to learning relational concepts in polynomial time and in a modular fashion."

In this problem, each processor starts with an arbitrary input value taken from a fixed set, and halts after choosing an output value. In every execution, at most k distinct output values may be chosen, and every processor's output value must be some processor's input value. We analyze this problem in a synchronous, message-passing model where processors fail by crashing. We prove a lower bound of [f/k] + 1 rounds of communication for solutions to k-set agreement that tolerate f failures, and we exhibit a protocol proving the matching upper bound. This result shows that there is an inherent tradeoff between the running time, the degree of coordination required, and the number of faults tolerated, even in idealized models like the synchronous model. The proof of this result is interesting because it is the first to apply topological techniques to the synchronous model."

Sorting algorithms working in this way are called periodic. The number of parallel steps performed during a single run of M is called its period, the sorting rime of M is the total number of parallel steps that are necessary to sort in the worst case. Periodic sorting networks have the advantage that they need little hardware (control logic, wiring, area) and that they are adaptive. We are interested in comparator networks of a constant period, due to their potential applications in hardware design. Previously, very little was known on such networks. The fastest solutions required time O(n(epsilon)), where the depth was roughly 1/epsilon. We introduce a general method called periodification scheme that converts automatically an arbitrary sorting network that sorts n items in time T(n) and that has layout area A(n) into a sorting network that has period 5, sorts Theta (n . T(n)) items in time O(T(n) . log n), and has layout area O(A(n) . T(n)). In particular, applying this scheme to Patcher's algorithms, we get practical period 5 comparator networks that sort in time O(log(3) n). For theoretical interest, one may use the AKS network resulting in a period 5 comparator network with runtime O(log(2) n)."

The spreading metric assigns lengths to either edges or vertices of the input graph, such that all subgraphs for which the optimization problem is nontrivial have large diameters. In addition, the spreading metric provides a lower bound, tau, on the cost of solving the optimization problem.

In resource augmentation analysis the on-line scheduler is given more resources, say faster processors or more processors, than the adversary. We apply this analysis to two well-known on-line scheduling problems, the classic uniprocessor CPU scheduling problem 1\r(i), pmtn\Sigma F-i, and the best-effort firm real-time scheduling problem 1\r(i), pmtn\Sigma w(i)(1 - U-i). It is known that there are no constant competitive nonclairvoyant on-line algorithms for these problems. We show that there are simple on-line scheduling algorithms for these problems that are constant competitive if the online scheduler is equipped with a slightly faster processor than the adversary. Thus, a moderate increase in processor speed effectively gives the on-line scheduler the power of clairvoyance. Furthermore, the on-line scheduler can be constant competitive on all inputs that are not closely correlated with processor speed. We also show that the performance of an on-line scheduler in best-effort real time scheduling can be significantly improved if the system is designed in such a way that the laxity of every job is proportional to its length."

Under this semantics, quantifiers range over elements of a relational database.

The second category includes results an the natural semantics, under which quantifier range over the entire interpreted structure. We prove, for a variety of structures, natural-active collapse results, showing that using unrestricted quantification does not give us any extra power. Moreover, for a variety of structures, including the real field, we give a set of algorithms for eliminating unbounded quantifications in favor of bounded ones. Furthermore, we extend these collapse results to a new class of higher-order logics that mix unbounded and bounded quantification. We give a set of normal forms for these logics, under special conditions on the interpreted structures.

If the system is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and will run ad infinitum, the optimal control policy can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming. The problems considered here assume that the time that the process will run is finite, and based on the size of the input. There are many factors that compound the complexity of computing the optimal policy. For instance, there are many factors that compound the complexity of this computation. For instance, if the controller does not have complete information about the state of the system, or if the system is represented in some very succinct manner, the optimal policy is provably not computable in time polynomial in the size of the input. We analyze the computational complexity of evaluating policies and of determining whether a sufficiently good policy exists for a MDP, based on a number of confounding factors, including the observability of the system state; the succinctness of the representation; the type of policy; even the number of actions relative to the number of states. In almost every case, we show that the decision problem is complete for some known complexity class.

It also plays an important role in the definition of some algorithms of unification module equational theories that are defined by confluent term rewriting systems. Due to the inefficiency of simple narrowing, many refined narrowing strategies have been proposed in the last decade. This paper presents a new narrowing strategy that is optimal in several respects. For this purpose, we propose a notion of a needed narrowing step that, for inductively sequential rewrite systems, extends the Huet and Levy notion of a needed reduction step.

They also reduce the computation of an common roots to a problem in linear algebra. We propose a determinantal formula for the sparse resultant of an arbitrary system of n + 1 polynomials in n variables. This resultant generalizes the classical one and has significantly lower degree for polynomials that are sparse in the sense that their mixed volume is lower than their Bezout number. Our algorithm uses a mixed polyhedral subdivision of the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes in order to construct a Newton matrix. Its determinant is a nonzero multiple of the sparse resultant and the latter equals the GCD of at most n + 1 such determinants. This construction implies a restricted version of an effective sparse Nullstellensatz. For an arbitrary specialization of the coefficients, there are two methods that use one extra variable and yield the sparse resultant. This is the first algorithm to handle the general case with complexity polynomial in the resultant degree and simply exponential in n. We conjecture its extension to producing an exact rational expression for the sparse resultant."

The class of bounded-degree polynomials over infinite fields. The class of XOR of terms. Certain classes of boxes in high dimensions. In addition, we obtain the best query complexity for several classes known to be learnable by other methods such as decision trees and polynomials over GF(2). While multiplicity automata are shown to be useful to prove the learnability of some subclasses of DNF formulae and various other classes, we study the limitations of this method. We prove that this method cannot be used to resolve the learnability of some other open problems such as the learnability of general DNF formulas or even k-term DNF for k = omega(log n) or satisfy-s DNF formulas for s = omega(1).

On the other hand, for branching temporal logic, automate-theoretic techniques have long been thought to introduce an exponential penalty, making them essentially useless for model-checking. Recently, Bernholtz and Grumberg [1993] have shown that this exponential penalty can be avoided, though they did not match the linear complexity of non-automata-theoretic algorithms. In this paper, we show that alternating tree automata are the key to a comprehensive automata-theoretic framework for branching temporal logics. Not only can they be used to obtain optimal decision procedures, as was shown by Muller ct al., but, as we show here, they also make it possible to derive optimal model-checking algorithms. Moreover, the simple combinatorial structure that emerges from the automata-theoretic approach opens up new possibilities for the implementation of branching-time model checking, and has enabled us to derive improved space complexity bounds for this long-standing problem."

Completeness and fixpoint completeness are shown to be properties that depend on the underlying abstract domains only. Our primary goal is then to solve the problem of making abstract interpretations complete by minimally extending or restricting the underlying abstract domains. Under the weak and reasonable hypothesis of dealing with continuous semantic operations, we provide constructive characterizations; for the least complete extensions and the greatest complete restrictions of abstract domains. As far as fixpoint completeness is concerned, for merely monotone semantic operators, the greatest restrictions of abstract domains are constructively characterized, while it is shown that the existence of least extensions of abstract domains cannot be, in general, guaranteed, even under strong hypotheses. These methodologies, which in finite settings give rise to effective algorithms, provide advanced formal tools for manipulating and comparing abstract interpretations, useful both in static program analysis and in semantics design.

Our main result is an O(mn(epsilon 0) + s(m + n(1+epsilon 0))) work polylog-time randomized algorithm that computes paths within (1 + O(1/polylog n)) of shortest from s source nodes to all other nodes in weighted undirected networks with n nodes and m edges (for any fixed epsilon(0) > 0), This work bound nearly matches the O(sm) sequential time. In contrast, previous polylog-time algorithms required min{O(n(3)), O(m(2))} work (even when s = 1), and previous near-linear work algorithms required near-O(n) time. We also present faster sequential algorithms that provide good approximate distances only between \""distant\"" vertices: We obtain an O((m + sn)n(epsilon 0)) time algorithm that computes paths of weight (1 + O(1/polylog n)) dist + O(w(max) polylog n), where dist is the corresponding distance and w(max) is the maximum edge weight.

A bounding-box-based heuristic avoids unnecessary intersection processing by eliminating the pairs whose bounding boxes are disjoint. Empirical evidence suggests that the heuristic works well in many practical applications, although its worst-case performance can be bad for certain pathological inputs. What is a pathological input, however, is not well understood, and consequently there is no guarantee that the heuristic will always work well in a specific application. In this paper, we analyze the performance of bounding box heuristic in terms of two natural shape parameters, aspect ratio and scale factor. These parameters can be used to realistically measure the degree to which the objects are pathologically shaped. We derive tight worst-case bounds on the performance for bounding box heuristic. One of the significant contributions of our paper is that we only require that objects be well shaped on average.

Job processing times are not known in advance, they are realized on-line according to given probability distributions. The aim is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the objective in expectation. Motivated by the success of LP-based approaches to deterministic scheduling, we present a polyhedral relaxation of the performance space of stochastic parallel machine scheduling. This relaxation extends earlier relaxations that have been used, among others, by Hall et al. [1997] in the deterministic setting. We then derive constant performance guarantees for priority policies which are guided by optimum LP solutions, and thereby generalize previous results from deterministic scheduling. In the absence of release dates, the LP-based analysis also yields an additive performance guarantee for the WSEPT rule which implies both a worst-case performance ratio and a result on its asymptotic optimality, thus complementing previous work by Weiss [1990]. The corresponding LP lower bound generalizes a previous lower bound from deterministic scheduling due to Eastman et al. [1964], and exhibits a relation between parallel machine problems and corresponding problems with only one fast single machine.

H is a universal class of hash functions for any finite field. but with respect to our measure different fields behave differently. If the finite field F has n elements, then there is a bad set S subset of F-2 of size n with expected maximal bucket size Ohm(n1/3). If n is a perfect square, then there is even a bad set with largest bucket size always at least root n. (This is worst possible, since with respect to a universal class of hash functions every set of size n has expected largest bucket size below root n + 1/2.) If, however, we consider the field of two elements, then we yet much better bounds. The best previously known upper bound on the expected size of the largest bucket for this class was O(2(root log n)). We reduce this upper bound to O(log n log log n). Note that this is not far from the guarantee for a random function. There. the average largest bucket would be theta(log ni log log n). In the course of our proof we develop a tool which may be of independent interest. Suppose we have a subset S of a vector space D over Z(2), and consider a random linear mapping of D to a smaller vector space R.

We prove the first nontrivial sample complexity lower bound in this model by showing that order of epsilon/Delta(2) + d/Delta (up to logarithmic factors) examples are necessary for PAC learning any target class of {0, 1}-valued functions of VC dimension d, where epsilon is the desired accuracy and eta = epsilon/(1 + epsilon) - h the malicious noise rate (it is well known that any nontrivial target class cannot be PAC learned with accuracy epsilon and malicious noise rate eta greater than or equal to epsilon(1 + epsilon), this irrespective to sample complexity). We also show that this result cannot be significantly improved in general by presenting efficient learning algorithms for the class of all subsets of d elements and the class of unions of at most d intervals on the real line. This is especially interesting as we can also show that the popular minimum disagreement strategy needs samples of size d epsilon/Delta(2), hence is not optimal with respect to sample size. We then discuss the use of randomized hypotheses. For these the bound epsilon/(1 + epsilon) on the noise rate is no longer true and is replaced by 2 epsilon/(1 + 2 epsilon). In fact, we present a generic algorithm using randomized hypotheses that can tolerate noise rates slightly larger than epsilon/(1 + epsilon) while using samples of size die as in the noise-free case.

Specifically, our analysis shows that the expected time to execute a fully strict computation on P processors using our work-stealing scheduler is T-1/P + O(T-proportional to), where T-1 is the minimum serial execution time of the multithreaded computation and T-proportional to is the minimum execution time with an infinite number of processors. Moreover, the space required by the execution is at most S1P, where S-1 is the minimum serial space requirement. We also show that the expected total communication of the algorithm is at most O(PTproportional to(1 + n(d))S-max), where S-max is the size of the largest activation record of any thread and n(d) is the maximum number of times that any thread synchronizes with its parent.

Such models are based on the established theory that the DNA sequences, or genomes, of all extant species have been derived from the genome of the common ancestor of all species by a process of random mutation and natural selection. A stochastic model of evolution can be used to construct phylogenies, or evolutionary trees, for a set of species. Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) methods seek the evolutionary tree which is most likely to have produced the DNA under consideration. While these methods are intellectually satisfying, they have not been widely accepted because of their computational intractability. In this paper, we address the intractability of MLE methods as follows: We introduce a metric on stochastic process models of evolution. We show that this metric is meaningful by proving that in order for any algorithm to distinguish between two stochastic models that are close according to this metric, it needs to be given many observations. We complement this result with a simple and efficient algorithm for inverting the stochastic process of evolution, that is, for building a tree from observations on two-state characters. (We will use the same techniques in a subsequent paper to solve the problem for multistate characters, and hence for building a tree from DNA sequence data.) The tree we build is provably close, in our metric, to the tree generating the data and gets closer as more observations become available. Though there have been many heuristics suggested for the problem of finding good approximations to the most likely tree, our algorithm is the first one with a guaranteed convergence rate, and further, this rate is within a polynomial of the lower-bound rate we establish. Ours is also the first polynomial-time algorithm that is proven to converge at all to the correct tree."

It is included in the GNU C++ library. Strikingly simple in design, the pairing heap data structure nonetheless seems difficult to analyze, belonging to the genre of self-adjusting data structures. With its design originating as a self-adjusting analogue of the Fibonacci heap, it has been previously conjectured that the pairing heap provides constant amortized time decrease-key operations, and experimental studies have supported this conjecture. This paper demonstrates, contrary to conjecture, that the pairing heap requires more than constant amortized time to perform decrease-key operations. Moreover, new experimental findings are presented that reveal detectable growth in the amortized cost of the decrease-key operation. Second, a unifying framework is developed that includes both pairing heaps and Fibonacci heaps. The parameter of interest in this framework is the storage capacity available in the nodes of the data structure for auxiliary balance information fields. In this respect Fibonacci heaps require log log n bits per node when n items are present. This is shown to be asymptotically optimal for data structures that achieve the same asymptotic performance bounds as Fibonacci heaps and fall within this framework."

The algorithms are designed using a new dynamic technique that combines a novel graph decomposition with randomization. They are Las-Vegas type randomized algorithms which use simple data structures and have a small constant factor. Let n denote the number of nodes in the graph. For a sequence of Omega(m(0)) operations, where m(0) is the number of edges in the initial graph, the expected time for p updates is O(p log(3) n) (Throughout the paper the logarithms are base 2.) for connectivity and bipartiteness. The worst-case time for one query is O(log n/log log n). For the k-edge witness problem (\Does the removal of k given edges disconnect the graph?\"") the expected time for p updates is O(p log(3) n) and the expected time for q queries is O(qk log(3) n). Given a graph with k different weights, the minimum spanning tree can be maintained during a sequence of p updates in expected time O(pk log(3) n).

Unlike previously known algorithms [Basu et al. 1996; Renegar 1992; Heintz et al. 1990], the combinatorial part of the complexity (the part depending on the number of polynomials in the input) of this new algorithm is independent of the number of free variables. Moreover, under the assumption that each polynomial in the input depend only on a constant number of the free variables, the algebraic part of the complexity (the part depending on the degrees of the input polynomials) can also be made independent of the number of free variables. This new feature of our algorithm allows us to obtain a new algorithm for a variant of the quantifier elimination problem. We give an almost optimal algorithm for this new problem, which we call the uniform quantifier elimination problem. Using the uniform quantifier elimination algorithm, we give an algorithm for solving a problem arising in the field of constraint databases with real polynomial constraints. We give an algorithm for converting a query with natural domain semantics to an equivalent one with active domain semantics. A nonconstructive version of this result was proved in Benedikt et al. [1998]. Very recently, a constructive proof was also given independently in Benedikt and Libkin [1997]. However, complexity issues were not considered and no algorithm with a reasonable complexity bound was known for this latter problem till now. We also point out interesting logical consequences of this algorithmic result, concerning the expressive power of a constraint query language over the reals. This leads to simpler and constructive proofs for these inexpressibility results than the ones known before. Moreover, our improved algorithm for performing quantifier elimination immediately leads to improved algorithms for several problems for which quantifier elimination is a basic step, for example, the problem of computing the closure of a given semi-algebraic set."

Simple and practical bit-vector algorithms have been designed for this problem, most notably the one used in agrep. These algorithms compute a bit representation of the current state-set of the k-difference automaton for the query, and asymptotically run in either O(nmk/w) or O(nm lag sigma/w) time where w is the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 or 63, in practice), and sigma is the size of the pattern alphabet. Here we present an algorithm of comparable simplicity that requires only O(nm/w) time by virtue of computing a bit representation of the relocatable dynamic programming matrix for the problem. Thus, the algorithm's performance is independent of k, and it is found to be more efficient than the previous results for many choices of k and small m. Moreover, because the algorithm is not dependent on k, it can be used to rapidly compute blocks of the dynamic programming matrix as in the 4-Russians algorithm of Wu ct al. [1996]. This gives rise to an O(kn/w) expected-time algorithm for the case where m may be arbitrarily large. In practice this new algorithm, that computes a region of the dynamic programming (d.p.) matrix w entries at a time using the basic algorithm as a subroutine, is significantly faster than our previous 4-Russians algorithm, that computes the same region 4 or 5 entries at a time using table lookup.

In order to make good use of this mapping technique in FPGA design, it is desirable to design FPGA logic modules based on Boolean functions which can be represented by a tree of gates (i.e., series-parallel or SP functions). Thakur and Wong [1996a; 1996b] studied this issue and they demonstrated the advantages of designing logic modules as universal SP functions, that is, SP functions which can implement all SP functions with a certain number of inputs. The number of variables in the universal function corresponds to the number of inputs to the FPGA module, so it is desirable to have as few variables as possible in the constructed functions. The universal SP functions presented in Thakur and Wong [1996a; 1996b] were designed manually. Recently, there is an algorithm that can generate these functions automatically [Young and 'Wong 1997], but the number of variables in the generated functions grows exponentially. In this paper, we present an algorithm to generate, for each n > 0, a universal SP function f(n), for implementing all SP functions with n inputs or less. The number of variables in f(n) is less than n(2.376),,and the constructions are the smallest possible when n is small (n less than or equal to 7).

Many of these errors result in distance measurements that can be safely assumed to lie within certain fixed tolerances. But a number of sources of systematic error in these experiments lead to inaccuracies in the data that are very hard to quantify; in effect, one must treat certain entries of the measured distance matrix as being arbitrarily \corrupted.\"" The existence of arbitrary errors leads to an interesting sort of error-correction problem-how many corrupted entries in a distance matrix can be efficiently corrected to produce a consistent three-dimensional structure? For the case of an n x n matrix in which every entry is specified, we provide a randomized algorithm running in time O(n log n) that enumerates all structures consistent with at most (1/2 - epsilon)n errors per row, with high probability. In the case of randomly located errors, we can correct errors of the same density in a sparse matrix-one in which only a beta fraction of the entries in each row are given, for any constant beta > 0."""

Consequently, the String B-Tree overcomes the theoretical limitations of inverted files, B-trees, prefix B-trees, suffix arrays, compacted tries and suffix trees. String B-trees have the same worst-case performance as B-trees but they manage unbounded-length strings and perform much more powerful search operations such as the ones supported by suffix trees.

As in the popular work-time framework for parallel algorithm design, programs written in such languages can express the full parallelism in the program without specifying the mapping of program tasks to processors. A common concern in executing such programs is to schedule tasks to processors dynamically so as to minimize not only the execution time, but also the amount of space (memory) needed. Without careful scheduling, the parallel execution on p processors can use a factor of p or larger more space than a sequential implementation of the same program. This paper first identifies a class of parallel schedules that are provably efficient in both time and space. For any computation with w units of work and critical path length d, and for any sequential schedule that takes space s(1), we provide a parallel schedule that lakes fewer than w/p + d steps on p processors and requires less than s(1) + p.d space. This matches the lower bound that we show, and significantly improves upon the best previous bound of s(1).p space for the common case where d much less than s(1) The paper then describes a scheduler for implementing high-level languages with nested parallelism, that generates schedules in this class. During program execution, as the structure of the computation is revealed, the scheduler keeps track of the active tasks, allocates the tasks to the processors, and performs the necessary task synchronization. The scheduler is itself a parallel algorithm, and incurs at most a constant factor overhead in time and space, even when the scheduling granularity is individual units of work. The algorithm is the first efficient solution to the scheduling problem discussed here, even if space considerations are ignored."

As an application of our compressed certificates, we develop efficient dynamic planar algorithms. In particular, we consider the following three operations on a planar graph G: (i) insert an edge if the resultant graph remains planar; (ii) delete an edge; and (iii) test whether an edge could be added to the graph without violating planarity. We show how to support each of the above operations in O(n(2/3)) time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. The bound for tests and deletions is worst-case, while the bound for insertions is amortized. This is the first algorithm for this problem with sub-linear running time, and it affirmatively answers a question posed in Eppstein ct al. [1992]. We use our compressed certificates for biconnectivity and triconnectivity to maintain the biconnected and triconnected components of a dynamic planar graph. The time bounds are the same: O(n(2/3)) worst-case time per edge deletion, O(n(2/3)) amortized time per edge insertion, and O(n(2/3)) worst-case time to check whether two vertices are either biconnected or triconnected."

The algorithm is called the LRU-K method, and reduces to the well-known LRU (Least Recently Used) method for K = 1. Previous work [O'Neil et al. 1993; Weikum ct al. 1994; Johnson and Shasha 1994] has shown the effectiveness for K > 1 by simulation, especially in the most common case of K = 2. The basic idea in LRU-K is to keep track of the times of the last K references to memory pages, and to use this statistical information to rank-order the pages as to their expected future behavior. Based on this the page replacement policy decision is made: which memory-resident page to replace when a newly accessed page must be read into memory. In the current paper, we prove, under the assumptions of the independent reference model, that LRU-K is optimal. Specifically we show: given the times of the (up to)K most recent references to each disk page, no other algorithm A making decisions to keep pages in a memory buffer holding n - 1 pages based on this information can improve on the expected number of I/Os to access pages over the LRU-K algorithm using a memory buffer holding n pages. The proof uses the Bayesian formula to relate the space of actual page probabilities of the model to the space of observable page numbers on which the replacement decision is actually made."

In a randomized wait-free setting, this classification is degenerate, since n-process consensus can be solved using only O(n) read-write registers. In this paper, we propose a classification of synchronization primitives based on the space complexity of randomized solutions to n-process consensus. A historyless object, such as a read-write register, a swap register, or a test&set register, is an object whose state depends only on the last nontrivial operation that was applied to it. We show that, using historyless objects, Omega(root n) object instances are necessary to solve n-process consensus. This lower bound holds even if the objects have unbounded size and the termination requirement is nondeterministic solo termination, a property strictly weaker than randomized wait-freedom. We then use this result to relate the randomized space complexity of basic multiprocessor synchronization primitives such as shared counters, fetch&add registers, and compare&swap registers. Viewed collectively, our results imply that there is a separation based on space complexity for synchronization primitives in randomized computation, and that this separation differs from that implied by the deterministic \""wait-free hierarchy.\"""""	"Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada; Brown Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; DEC Cambridge Res Lab, Cambridge, England"	"Fich, F (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada"				NA	30	26	26	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036 USA"	11-Apr	NA	J ACM	J.

For queries formulated as sets of pure Horn rules, the problem of determining finiteness is, in general, undecidable. In this paper, we consider superfiniteness-a stronger kind of finiteness, which applies to Horn queries whose function symbols are replaced by the abstraction of infinite relations with finiteness constraints (abbr., FC's). We show that superfiniteness is not only decidable but also axiomatizable, and the axiomatization yields an effective decision procedure. Although there are finite queries that are not superfinite, we demonstrate that superfinite queries represent an interesting and nontrivial subclass within the class of all finite queries. Then we turn to the issue of inference of finiteness constraints-an important practical problem that is instrumental in deciding if a query is evaluable by a bottom-up algorithm. Although it is not known whether FC-entailment is decidable for sets of function-free Horn rules, we show that super-entailment, a stronger form of entailment, is decidable.

State enumeration approaches are well-suited to the verification of cache protocols but they face the problem of state space explosion, leading to unacceptable verification time and memory consumption even for small system configurations. One way to manage this complexity and make the verification feasible is to map the system model to verify onto a symbolic state model (SSM). Since the number of symbolic states is considerably less than the number of system states, an exhaustive state search becomes possible, even for large-scale systems and complex protocols. In this paper, we develop the concepts and notations to verify some properties of a directory-based protocol designed for non-FIFO interconnection networks. We compare the verification of the protocol with SSM and with the Stanford Mur phi, a verification tool enumerating system states. We show that SSM is much more efficient in terms of verification time and memory consumption and therefore holds the promise of verifying much more complex protocols. A unique feature of SSM is that it verifies protocols for any system size and therefore provides reliable verification results in one run of the tool."

We show that to guarantee at most constant bias, Omega(t(2)) local coins are needed, even if (a) the local coins can have arbitrary distributions and ranges, (b) the adversary is required to decide immediately whether to hide or reveal each local coin, and (c) the game can detect which local coins have been hidden.

We present a randomized polynomial time algorithm that colors a 3-colorable graph on n vertices with min {O(Delta(1/3) log(1/2) Delta log n), O(n(1/4) log(1/2) n)} colors where Delta is the maximum degree of any vertex. Besides giving the best known approximation ratio in terms of n, this marks the first nontrivial approximation result as a function of the maximum degree Delta. This result can be generalized to k-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using min {O(Delta(1-2/k) log(1/2) Delta log n), O(n(1-3/(k+1)) log(1/2) n)} colors. Our results are inspired by the recent work of Goemans and Williamson who used an algorithm for semidefinite optimization problems, which generalize linear programs, to obtain improved approximations for the MAX CUT and MAX 2-SAT problems. An intriguing outcome of our work is a duality relationship established between the value of the optimum solution to our semidefinite program and the Lovasz theta-function. We show lower bounds on the gap between the optimum solution of our semidefinite program and the actual chromatic number; by duality this also demonstrates interesting new facts about the theta-function."

First, methods from topology are used to analyze triangulated 3-manifolds in R-3. Then, it is shown that these methods can, in fact, be applied to arbitrary simplicial complexes in R-3 after (simulating) the process of thickening a complex to a 3-manifold homotopic to it. As a consequence considerable structural information about the complex can be determined and certain discrete problems solved as well.

If several processes simultaneously attempt to allocate a particular resource (as may be expected to occur, since the processes cannot easily coordinate their allocations), then none succeed. In such a framework, it is a challenge to design efficient contention resolution protocols. Two recently-proposed approaches to the problem of PRAM emulation give rise to scheduling problems of the above kind. In one approach, the resources (in this case, the shared memory cells) are duplicated and distributed randomly. We analyze a simple and efficient deterministic algorithm for accessing some subset of the duplicated resources. In the other approach, we analyze how quickly we can access the given (nonduplicated) resource using a simple randomized strategy. We obtain precise bounds on the performance of both strategies.

Furthermore, noting that relational queries exhibit several forms of genericity, we establish a number of collapse results of the following form: The class of generic Boolean queries expressible in the relational calculus augmented with a given class of constraints coincides with the class of queries expressible in the relational calculus (with or without an order relation). We prove such results for both the natural and active-domain semantics. As a consequence, the relational calculus augmented with polynomial inequalities expresses the same classes of generic Boolean queries under both the natural and active-domain semantics. In the course of proving these results for the active-domain semantics, we establish Ramsey-type theorems saying that any query involving certain kinds of constraints coincides with a constraint-free query on databases whose elements come from a certain infinite subset of the domain.

The algorithm caches objects in the local memory of processors according to application needs; each read operation accesses a single copy of the object, while each update accesses all copies. The algorithm uses broadcast communication when it sends messages to replicated copies of an object, and it uses point-to-point communication when a message is sent to a single copy, and when a reply is returned. Copies of all the objects are kept consistent using a strategy based on sequence numbers for broadcasts. The algorithm is presented in two layers. The lower layer uses the given broadcast and point-to-point communication services, plus sequence numbers, to provide a new communication service called a context multicast channel. The higher layer uses a context multicast channel to manage the object replication in a consistent fashion.

Both the size of neuromata (i.e., the number of neurons) and their descriptional complexity (i.e., the number of bits in the neuromaton representation) are studied. It is proved that a constant time delay of the neuromaton output does not play a role within a polynomial descriptional complexity. It is shown that any regular language given by a regular expression of length n is recognized by a neuromaton with Theta(n) neurons. Further, it is proved that this network size is, in the worst case, optimal. On the other hand, generally there is not an equivalent polynomial length regular expression for a given neuromaton. Then, two specialized constructions of neural accepters of the optimal descriptional complexity Theta(n) for a single n-bit string recognition are described. They both require O(n(1/2)) neurons and either O(n) connections with constant weights or O(n(1/2)) edges with weights of the O(2(root n)) size. Furthermore, the concept of Hopfield languages is introduced by means of so-called Hopfield neuromata (i.e., of neural networks with symmetric weights). It is proved that the class of Hopfield languages is strictly contained in the class of regular languages. The necessary and sufficient so-called Hopfield condition stating when a regular language is a Hopfield language, is formulated. A construction of a Hopfield neuromaton is presented for a regular language satisfying the Hopfield condition. The class of Hopfield languages is shown to be closed under union, intersection, concatenation and complement, and it is not closed under iteration. Finally, the problem whether a regular language given by a neuromaton (or by a Hopfield acceptor) is nonempty, is proved to be PSPACE-complete.

In practice, however, performance of multiprocessor algorithms is heavily influenced by contention, the extent to which processes access the same location at the same time. Nevertheless, even though contention is one of the principal considerations affecting the performance of real algorithms on real multiprocessors, there are no formal tools for analyzing the contention of asynchronous shared-memory algorithms. This paper introduces the first formal complexity model for contention in shared-memory multiprocessors. We focus on the standard multiprocessor architecture in which n asynchronous processes communicate by applying lead, write, and read-modify-write operations to a shared memory. To illustrate the utility of our model, we use it to derive two kinds of results: (1) lower bounds on contention for well-known basic problems such as agreement and mutual exclusion, and (2) trade-offs between the length of the critical path (maximal number of accesses to shared variables performed by a single process in executing the algorithm) and contention for these algorithms. Furthermore, we give the first formal contention analysis of a variety of counting networks, a class of concurrent data structures implementing shared counters. Experiments indicate that certain counting networks outperform conventional single-variable counters at high levels of contention. Our analysis provides the first formal model explaining this phenomenon."

First, a new and natural problem in this domain is defined: Does there exists a sound and complete termination condition for a motion, given initial and goal locations? If yes, how to construct it? Then we define a high-level language, a logic of time and knowledge, which we use to reason about termination conditions and to state general conditions for the existence of sound and complete termination conditions in a broad domain.

The Learning (in order) to Reason approach developed here views learning as an integral part of the inference process, and suggests that learning and reasoning should be studied together. The Learning to Reason framework combines the interfaces to the world used by known learning models with the reasoning task and a performance criterion suitable for it. In this framework, the intelligent agent is given access to its favorite learning interface, and is also given a grace period in which it can interact with this interface and construct a representation KB of the world W. The reasoning performance is measured only after this period, when the agent is presented with queries ct from some query language, relevant to the world, and has to answer whether W implies alpha. The approach is meant to overcome the main computational difficulties in the traditional treatment of reasoning which stem from its separation from the \world\"". Since the agent interacts with the world when constructing its knowledge representation it can choose a representation that is useful for the task at hand. Moreover, we can now make explicit the dependence of the reasoning performance on the environment the agent interacts with. We show how previous results from learning theory and reasoning fit into this framework and illustrate the usefulness of the Learning to Reason approach by exhibiting new results that ale not possible in the traditional setting. First, we give Learning to Reason algorithms for classes of propositional languages for which there are no efficient reasoning algorithms, when represented as a traditional (formula-based) knowledge base. Second, we exhibit a Learning to Reason algorithm for a class of propositional languages that is not known to be learnable in;the traditional sense."""

We then investigate all the different possible forms of this algebraic closure property, and establish which of these are sufficient to ensure tractability. As examples, we show that all known classes of tractable constraints over finite domains can be characterized by such an algebraic closure property.

In this paper, we identify two new complementary properties on the restrictiveness of the constraints in a network-constraint tightness and constraint looseness-and we show their usefulness for estimating the level of local consistency needed to ensure global consistency, and for estimating the level of local consistency present in a network. In particular, we present a sufficient condition, based on constraint tightness and the level of local consistency, that guarantees that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. The condition can be useful in applications where a knowledge base will be queried over and over and the preprocessing costs can be amortized over many queries. We also present a sufficient condition for local consistency, based on constraint looseness, that is straightforward and inexpensive to determine. The condition can be used to estimate the level of local consistency of a network. This in turn can be used in deciding whether it would be useful to preprocess the network before a backtracking search, and in deciding which local consistency conditions, if any, still need to be enforced if we want to ensure that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. Two definitions of local consistency are employed in characterizing the conditions: the traditional variable-based notion and a recently introduced definition of local consistency called relational consistency."

Recent focus has mostly been on wait-free implementations, which permit every process to complete its operations on implemented objects, regardless of the speeds of other processes. It is known that shared objects of different types have differing abilities to support wait-free implementations. It is therefore natural to want to arrange types in a hierarchy that reflects their relative abilities to support wait-free implementations. In this paper, we formally define robustness and other desirable properties of hierarchies. Roughly speaking, a hierarchy is robust if each type is ''stronger'' than any combination of lower level types. We study two specific hierarchies: one, that we call h(m)(r), in which the level of a type is based on the ability of an unbounded number of objects of that type, and another hierarchy, that we call h(1)(r), in which a type's level is based on the ability of a fixed number of objects of that type. We prove that resource bounded hierarchies, such as h; and its variants, are not robust. We also establish the unique importance of h(m)(r): every nontrivial robust hierarchy, if one exists, is necessarily a ''coarsening'' of h(m)(r)."

These laws define a distribution-free convergence property of means to expectations uniformly over classes of random variables. Classes of real-valued functions enjoying such a property are also known as uniform Glivenko-Cantelli classes. In this paper, we prove, through a generalization of Sauer's lemma that may be interesting in its own right, a new characterization of uniform Glivenko-Cantelli classes. Our characterization yields Dudley, Gine, and Zinn's previous characterization as a corollary. Furthermore, it is the first based on a simple combinatorial quantity generalizing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. We apply this result to obtain the weakest combinatorial condition known to imply PAC learnability in the statistical regression (or ''agnostic'') framework. Furthermore, we find a characterization of learnability in the probabilistic concept model, solving an open problem posed by Kearns and Schapire.

This mesh refinement problem turns out to be strongly NP-hard. In commercial CAD systems, this problem is usually solved using a greedy approach. However, these algorithms leave the user a lot of patchwork to do afterwards. We introduce a new global approach, which is based on network now techniques. Abstracting from all geometric and numerical aspects, we obtain an undirected graph with upper and lower capacities on the edges and some additional node constraints. We reduce this problem to a sequence of bidirected flow problems (or, equivalently, to b-matching problems). For the first time, network flow techniques are applied to a mesh refinement problem. This approach avoids the local traps of greedy approaches and yields solutions that require significantly less additional patchwork."

We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases.

We concentrate on the case of permanent virtual circuits (i.e., once a circuit is established, it exists forever), and describe an algorithm that achieves an O(log n) competitive ratio with respect to maximum congestion, where n is the number of nodes in the network. Informally, our results show that instead of knowing all of the future requests, it is sufficient to increase the bandwidth of the communication links by an O(log n) factor. We also show that this result is tight, that is, for any on-line algorithm there exists a scenario in which Omega(log n) increase in bandwidth is necessary in directed networks. We view virtual circuit routing as a generalization of an on-line load balancing problem, defined as follows: jobs arrive on line and each job must be assigned to one of the machines immediately upon arrival. Assigning a job to a machine increases the machine's load by an amount that depends both on the job and on the machine. The goal is to minimize the maximum load. For the related machines case, we describe the first algorithm that achieves constant competitive ratio. For the unrelated case (with n machines), we describe a new method that yields O(log n)-competitive algorithm. This stands in contrast to the natural greedy approach, whose competitive ratios is exactly n."

It is well known that all strictness analysis methods are incomplete, i.e., fair to report some strictness properties. In this paper, we provide a precise and formal characterization of the loss of information that leads to this incompleteness. Specifically, we establish the following characterization theorem for Mycroft's strictness analysis method and a generalization of this method, called ee-analysis, that reasons about exhaustive evaluation in nonflat domains: Mycroft's method will deduce a strictness property for program P iff the property is independent of any constant appearing in any evaluation of P. To prove this, we specify a small set of equations, called E-axioms, that capture the information loss in Mycroft's method and develop a new proof technique called E-rewriting. E-rewriting extends the standard notion of rewriting to permit the use of reductions using E-axioms interspersed with standard reduction steps. E-axioms are a syntactic characterization of information loss and E-rewriting provides an algorithm-independent proof technique for characterizing the power of analysis methods. It can be used to answer questions on completeness and incompleteness of Mycroft's method on certain natural classes of programs. Finally, the techniques developed in this paper provide a general principle for establishing similar results for other analysis methods such as those based on abstract interpretation. As a demonstration of the generality of our technique, we give a characterization theorem for another variation of Mycroft's method called dd-analysis."

To remedy this mismatch, the ''constructive'' transformations are proposed. It is shown that the constructive transformations are precisely the transformations that can be expressed in said extensions of complete standard languages.

Informally, what is gained with respect to the search for a proof by performing a single resolution step? It is first shown that any unsatisfiable formula may be decomposed into regular formulas provable in linear time (by resolution). A relevant resolution step strictly reduces at least one of the formulas in the decomposition while an irrelevant one does not contribute to the proof in any way. The relevance of this insight into the nature of resolution and of the unsatisfiability problem for the development of proof strategies and for complexity considerations are briefly discussed. The decomposition also provides a technique for establishing completeness proofs for refinements of resolution, As a first application, connection-graph resolution is shown to be strongly complete. This settles a problem that remained open for two decades despite many proof attempts. The result is relevant for theorem proving because without strong completeness a connection graph resolution prover might run into an infinite loop even on the ground level."

On one side, we have fixpoint logic, parameterized by the choices of 1st-order operators (inflationary or noninflationary) and iteration constructs (deterministic, nondeterministic, or alternating). On the other side, we have the complexity classes between P and EXPTIME. Our parameterized fixpoint logics capture the complexity classes P, NP, PSPACE, and EXPTIME, but equality is achieved only over ordered structures. There is, however, an inherent mismatch between complexity and logic-while computational devices work on encodings of problems, logic is applied directly to the underlying mathematical structures. To overcome this mismatch, we use a theory of relational complexity, which bridges the gap between standard complexity and fixpoint logic. On one hand, we show that questions about containments among standard complexity classes can be translated to questions about containments among relational complexity classes. On the other hand, the expressive power of fixpoint logic can be precisely characterized in terms of relational complexity classes. This tight, three-way relationship among fixpoint logics, relational complexity and standard complexity yields in a uniform way logical analogs to all containments among the complexity classes P, NP, PSPACE, and EXPTIME. The logical formulation shows that some of the most tantalizing questions in complexity theory boil down to a single question: the relative power of inflationary vs. noninflationary 1st-order operators."

The ordering of joins determines to a large extent the computation time of the join. Since the number of possible orderings could be very large, query optimizers first reduce the search space by using various heuristics and then try to select an optimal ordering of joins. Avoiding Cartesian products is a common heuristic for reducing the search space, but it cannot guarantee optimal ordering in its search space, because the cheapest Cartesian-product-free (CPF, for short) ordering could be significantly worse than an optimal non-CPF ordering by a factor of an arbitrarily large number. In this paper, we use programs consisting of joins, semijoins, and projections for computing the join of some relations, and we introduce a novel algorithm that derives programs from CPF orderings of joins. We show that there exists a CPF ordering from which our algorithm derives a program whose cost is within a constant factor of the cost of an optimal ordering.

We call an emulation work-preserving if the time required by the host, T-H, is O(TGNG/N-H), because then both the guest and host networks perform the same total work (i.e., processor-time product), Theta(TGNG), to within a constant factor. We say that an emulation occurs in real-time if T-H = O(T-G), because then the host emulates the guest with constant slowdown. In addition to describing several work-preserving and real-time emulations, we also provide a general model in which lower bounds can be proved. Some of the more interesting and diverse consequences of this work include: (1) a proof that a linear array can emulate a (much larger) butterfly in a work-preserving fashion, but that a butterfly cannot emulate an expander (of any size) in a work-preserving fashion, (2) a proof that a butterfly can emulate a shuffle-exchange network in a real-time work-preserving fashion, and vice versa, (3) a proof that a butterfly can emulate a mesh (or an array of higher, but fixed, dimension) in a real-time work-preserving fashion, even though any O(1)-to-1 embedding of an N-node mesh in an N-node butterfly has dilation Omega(log N), and (4) simple O(N-2/log(2) N)-area and O(N-3/2/log(3/2) N)-volume layouts for the N-node shuffle-exchange network."

These methods can be used to convert a circuit with edge-triggered latches into a faster level-clocked one. We model a two-phase circuit as a graph G = (V, E) whose vertex set V is a collection of combinational logic blocks, and whose edge set E is a set of interconnections. Each interconnection passes through zero or more latches, where each latch is clocked by one of two periodic, nonoverlapping waveforms, or phases. We give efficient polynomial-time algorithms for problems involving the timing verification and optimization of two-phase circuitry. Included are algorithms for verifying proper timing: O(VE) time. minimizing the clock period by clock tuning: O(VE) time. retiming to achieve a given clock period when the phases are symmetric: O(VE + V-2 lg V) time. retiming to achieve a given clock period when either the duty cycle (high time) of one phase or the ratio of the phases' duty cycles is fixed: O(V-3) time. We give fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for clock period minimization, within any given relative error epsilon > 0, by retiming and tuning when the duty cycles of the two phases are required to be equal: O((VE + V-2 lg V)lg(V/epsilon)) time. retiming and tuning when either the duly cycle of one phase is fixed or the ratio of the phases' duty cycles is fixed: O(V-3 lg(V/epsilon)) time. simultaneous retiming and clock tuning with no conditions on the duty cycles of the two phases: O(V-3(1/epsilon)lg(1/epsilon) + (VE + V-2 Ig V)lg(V/epsilon)) time. The first two of these approximation algorithms can be used to obtain the optimum clock period in the special case where all propagation delays are integers. We generalize most of the results for two-phase clocking schemes to simple multiphase clocking disciplines, including ones with overlapping phases. Typically, the algorithms to verify and optimize the timing of k-phase circuitry are at most a factor of k slower than the corresponding algorithms for two-phase circuitry. Our algorithms have been implemented in TIM, a timing package for two-phase, level-clocked circuitry developed at MIT."

We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, that is, the constructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification.

Given a magic sets rewritten query, the set of facts generated for the original, nonmagic predicates by the seminaive bottom-up evaluation is characterized precisely. It is shown that-because of the additional magic facts-magic sets processing may result in generating an order of magnitude more facts than the straightforward naive evaluation. A refinement of magic sets called factorized magic sets is defined. These magic sets retain most of the efficiency of original magic sets in regards to the number of nonmagic facts generated and have the property that a linear-time bound with respect to seminaive evaluation is guaranteed in all cases. An alternative technique for magic sets, called envelopes, which has several desirable properties over magic sets, is introduced. Envelope predicates are never recursive with the original predicates; thus, envelopes can be computed as a preprocessing task. Envelopes also allow the utilization of multiple sideways information passing strategies (sips) for a rule. An envelope-transformed program may be ''readorned'' according to another choice of sips and reoptimized by magic sets (or envelopes), thus making possible an optimization effect that cannot be achieved by magic sets based on a particular choice of sips."

Our prediction algorithms for prefetching are novel in that they are based on data compression techniques that are both theoretically optimal and good in practice. Intuitively, in order to compress data effectively, you have to be able to predict future data well, and thus good data compressors should be able to predict well for purposes of prefetching.

Both the criterion and the techniques originate from logic programming [van Gelder et al. 1988; Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988] to which TSSs are close.

The fundamental principle is simple: the edges in a graph's minimum cut form an extremely small fraction of the graph's edges. Using this idea, we give a randomized, strongly polynomial algorithm that finds the minimum cut in an arbitrarily weighted undirected graph with high probability. The algorithm runs in O(n(2)log(3)n) time, a significant improvement over the previous (O) over tilde(mn) time bounds based on maximum flows. It is simple and intuitive and uses no complex data structures. Our algorithm can be parallelized to run in RNC with n(2) processors; this gives the first proof that the minimum cut problem can be solved in RNC. The algorithm does more than find a single minimum cut; it finds all of them. With minor modifications, our algorithm solves two other problems of interest. Our algorithm finds all cuts with value within a multiplicative factor of cu of the minimum cut's in expected (O) over tilde(n(2 alpha)) time, or in RNC with n(2 alpha) processors. The problem of finding a minimum multiway cut of a graph into r pieces is solved in expected (O) over tilde(n(2(r-1))) time, or in RNC with n(2(r-1)) processors. The ''trace'' of the algorithm's execution on these two problems forms a new compact data structure for representing all small cuts and all multiway cuts in a graph. This data structure can be efficiently transformed into the more standard cactus representation for minimum cuts."

The main result is that any monotone Boolean function has most of its power spectrum on its Fourier coefficients of ''degree'' at most O(root n) under any product distribution. This is similar to a result of Linial et al. [1993], which showed that AC(0) functions have almost all of their power spectrum on the coefficients of degree, at most (log n)(O(1)), under the uniform distribution. As a consequence of the main result, the following two corollaries are obtained: For any epsilon > 0, monotone Boolean functions are PAC learnable with error a under product distributions in time 2((O) over tilde((1/epsilon)root n)). Any monotone Boolean function can be approximated within error epsilon under product distributions by a non-monotone Boolean circuit of size 2((O) over tilde(1/epsilon root n)) and depth (O) over tilde(1/epsilon root n). The learning algorithm runs in time subexponential as long as the required error is Ohm(1/(root n log n)). It is shown that this is tight in the sense that for any subexponential time algorithm there is a monotone Boolean function for which this algorithm cannot approximate with error better than. The main result is also applied to other problems in learning and complexity theory. In learning theory, several polynomial-time algorithms for learning some classes of monotone Boolean functions, such as Boolean functions with O(log(2)n/log log n) relevant variables, are presented. In complexity theory, some questions regarding monotone NP-complete problems are addressed."

There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves. In this paper, we provide theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce the problem of software protection to the problem of efficient simulation on oblivious RAM. A machine is oblivious if the sequence in which it accesses memory locations is equivalent for any two inputs with the same running time. For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, the movement is independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of a machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer showed how a two-tape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a one-tape Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a probabilistic oblivious RAM with a polylogarithmic slowdown in the running time. On the other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a lower bound."

We attempt to take some initial steps towards the development of a theoretical basis for a multimedia information system. To do so, we develop the notion of a structured multimedia database system. We begin by defining a mathematical model of a media-instance. A media-instance may be thought of as ''glue'' residing on top of a specific physical media-representation (such as video, audio, documents, etc.) Using this ''glue'', it is possible to define a general purpose logical query language to query multimedia data. This glue consists of a set of ''states'' (e.g., video frames, audio tracks, etc.) and ''features'', together with relationships between states and/or features. A structured multimedia database system imposes a certain mathematical structure on the set of features/states. Using this notion of a structure, we are able to define indexing structures for processing queries, methods to relax queries when answers do not exist to those queries, as well as sound, complete and terminating procedures to answer such queries (and their relaxations, when appropriate). We show how a media-presentation can be generated by processing a sequence of queries, and furthermore we show that when these queries are extended to include constraints, then these queries can not only generate presentations, but also generate temporal synchronization properties and spatial layout properties for such presentations. We describe the architecture of a prototype multimedia database system based on the principles described in this paper."

Milner's notion of observation equivalence is often mentioned as the standard example of a branching time equivalence. In this paper we investigate whether observation equivalence really does respect the branching structure of processes, and find that in the presence of the unobservable action tau of CCS this is not the case. Therefore, the notion of branching bisimulation equivalence is introduced which strongly preserves the branching structure of processes, in the sense that it preserves computations together with the potentials in all intermediate states that are passed through, even if silent moves are involved. On closed CCS-terms branching bisimulation congruence can be completely axiomatized by the single axiom scheme: a.(tau.(y + z) + y) = a.(y + z) (where a ranges over all actions) and the usual laws for strong congruence. We also establish that for sequential processes observation equivalence is not preserved under refinement of actions, whereas branching bisimulation is. For a large class of processes, it turns out that branching bisimulation and observation equivalence are the same. As far as we know, all protocols that have been verified in the setting of observation equivalence happen to fit in this class, and hence are also valid in the stronger setting of branching bisimulation equivalence."

We present a third alternative, in which knowledge given in a general representation language is translated (compiled) into a tractable form-allowing for efficient subsequent query answering. We show how propositional logical theories can be compiled into Horn theories that approximate the original information. The approximations bound the original theory from below and above in terms of logical strength. The procedures are extended to other tractable languages (for example, binary clauses) and to the first-order case.

Emulations are studied formally via graph embeddings, so the topic here becomes: How efficiently can one embed the graph underlying a given interconnection network in the graph underlying the butterfly network? Within this framework, the slowdown incurred by an emulation is measured by the sum of the dilation and the congestion of the corresponding embedding (respectively, the maximum amount that the embedding stretches an edge of the guest graph, and the maximum traffic across any edge of the host graph); the efficiency of resource utilization in an emulation is measured by the expansion of the corresponding embedding (the ratio of the sizes of the host to guest graph). Three main results expose a number of optimal emulations by butterfly networks. Call a family of graphs balanced if complete binary trees can be embedded in the family with simultaneous dilation, congestion, and expansion O(1). (1) The family of butterfly graphs is balanced. (2) (a) Any graph G from a family of maxdegree-d graphs having a recursive separator of size S(x) can be embedded in any balanced graph family with simultaneous dilation O(log(d Sigma(i) S(2(-i)\G\))) and expansion O(1). (b) Any dilation-D embedding of a maxdegree-d graph in a butterfly graph can be converted to an embedding having simultaneous dilation O(D) and congestion O(dD). (3) Any embedding of a planar graph G in a butterfly graph must have dilation Omega(log Sigma(G)/Phi(G)), where: Sigma(G) is the size of the smallest (1/3, 2/3)-node-separator of G, and Phi(G) is the size of G's largest interior face. Applications of these results include: (1) The n-node X-tree network can be emulated by the butterfly network with slowdown O(log log n) and expansion O(1); no embedding has dilation smaller than Omega(log log n), independent of expansion. (2) Every embedding of the n x n mesh in the butterfly graph has dilation Omega(log n); any expansion-O(1) embedding in the butterfly graph achieves dilation O(log n). These applications provide the first examples of networks that can be embedded more efficiently in hypercubes than in butterflies. We also show that analogues of these results hold for networks that are structurally related to the butterfly network. The upper bounds hold for the hypercube and the de Bruijn networks, possibly with altered constants. The lower bounds hold-at least in weakened form-for the de Bruijn network."

Examples of resources that may be managed by such an object include; number of messages sent, number of nodes participating in the protocol, and total CPU time consumed. The Resource Controller object is accessed through a procedure that can be invoked at any node in the network. Before consuming a unit of resource at some node, the controlled algorithm should invoke the procedure at this node, requesting a permit to consume a unit of the resource. The procedure returns either a permit or a rejection. The key characteristics of the Resource Controller object are the constraints that it imposes on the global resource consumption. An (M, W)-Controller guarantees that the total number of permits granted is at most M; it also ensures that, if a request is rejected, then at least M - W permits art eventually granted, even if no more requests are made after the rejected one. In this paper, we describe several message and space-efficient implementations of the Resource Controller object. fn particular, we present an (M, W)-Controller whose message complexity is O(n log(2)n log(M/(W + 1)) where n is the total number of nodes. This is in contrast to the O(nM) message complexity of a fully centralized controller which maintains a global counter of the number of granted permits at some distinguished node and relays all the requests to that node."

Despite its advantages for stack-based memory management, SLDNF is often not appropriate for query evaluation for three reasons: (a) it may nor terminate due to infinite positive recursion; (b) it may not terminate due to infinite recursion through negation; and (c) it may repeatedly evaluate the same literal in a rule body, leading to unacceptable performance. We address all three problems for goal-oriented query evaluation of general logic programs by presenting tabled evaluation with delaying, called SLG resolution. It has three distinctive features: (i) SLG resolution is a partial deduction procedure, consisting of seven fundamental transformations. A query is transformed step by step into a set of answers. The use of transformations separates logical issues of query evaluation from procedural ones, SLG allows an arbitrary computation rule for selecting a literal from a rule body and an arbitrary control strategy for selecting transformations to apply. (ii) SLG resolution is sound and search space complete with respect to the well-founded partial model for all non-floundering queries, and preserves all three-valued stable models. To evaluate a query under different three-valued stable models, SLG resolution can be enhanced by further processing of the answers of subgoals relevant to a query. (iii) SLG resolution avoids both positive and negative loops and always terminates for programs with the bounded-term-size property. It has a polynomial time data complexity for well-founded negation of function-free programs. Through a delaying mechanism for handling ground negative literals involved in loops, SLG resolution avoids the repetition of any of its derivation steps. Restricted forms of SLG resolution are identified for definite, locally stratified, and modularly stratified programs, shedding light on the role each transformation plays. SLG resolution makes many more rule specifications into effective programs. With simple (user or computer generated) annotations, both SLDNF resolution and SLG resolution can be used in a single application, allowing a smooth integration of Prolog computation and tabled evaluation of queries. Furthermore, Prolog compiler technology has been adapted for two efficient implementation of SLG resolution. For all these reasons, we believe that SLG resolution will provide the computational basis for the next generation of logic programming systems."

In this paper, we study three different approaches to computing stable models of logic programs based on mixed integer linear programming methods for automated deduction introduced by R. Jeroslow. We subsequently discuss the relative efficiency of these algorithms. The results of experiments with a prototype compiler implemented by us tend to confirm our theoretical discussion. In contrast to resolution, the mixed integer programming methodology is both fully declarative and handles reuse of old computations gracefully. We also introduce, compare, implement, and experiment with linear constraints corresponding to four semantics for ''explicit'' negation in logic programs: the four-valued annotated semantics [Blair and Subrahmanian 1989], the Gelfond-Lifschitz semantics [1990], the over-determined models [Grant and Subrahmanian 1990], and the classical logic semantics. Gelfond and Lifschitz [1990] argue for simultaneous use of two modes of negation in logic programs, ''classical'' and ''nonmonotonic,'' so we give algorithms for computing ''answer sets'' for such logic programs too."

A deficiency in the circumscriptive approach to common-sense reasoning has been its difficulties in producing default conclusions about equality; for example, one cannot, in general, conclude by default that Tweety not equal Blutto using ordinary circumscription, or conclude by default that a particular bird flies, if some birds are known not to fly. In this paper, we introduce a new form of circumscription, based on homomorphisms between models, that remedies these two problems and still retains the major desirable properties of traditional forms of circumscription."

A unique feature of the model is that it is not based on adding physical or virtual channels to direct networks (although it can be applied to networks with extra channels). Instead, the model is based on analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Prohibiting just enough turns to break all of the cycles produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free, livelock free, minimal or nonminimal, and highly adaptive. This paper focuses on the two most common network topologies for wormhole routing, rt-dimensional meshes and k-ary n-cubes without extra channels. In such networks, just a quarter of the turns must be prohibited to prevent deadlock. The remaining three quarters of the turns allow routing to be adaptive. Adaptive routing algorithms are described for two-dimensional meshes, n-dimensional meshes k-ary n-cubes, and hypercubes. Simulations of adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms show which algorithm has the lowest latencies and highest sustainable throughput depends on the pattern of message traffic. For nonuniform traffic, adaptive routing algorithms generally perform better than nonadaptive ones."

We give two counting network constructions, one of depth log n(1 + log n)/2 using n log n(1 + log n)/4 ''gates,'' and a second of depth log(2) n using n log(2) n/2 gates. These networks avoid the sequential bottlenecks inherent to earlier solutions, and substantially lower the memory contention.

We show how E-disunification can be reduced to E-unification, that is, solving equations only, and give a disunification algorithm for theories given a unification algorithm. In fact, this result shows that for theories in which the solutions of all unification problems can be represented by finitely many substitutions, the solutions of all disunification problems can also be represented finitely.

Let n denote the length of the optimal superstring. A common conjecture states that the above greedy procedure produces a superstring of length O(n) (in fact, 2n), yet the only previous nontrivial bound known for any polynomial-time algorithm is a recent O(n log n) result. We show that the greedy algorithm does in fact achieve a constant factor approximation, proving an upper bound of 4n.

Most often, Markov models are used in representing systems for dependability/availability analysis. Due to complex interactions between components and complex repair policies, the Markov model often has an irregular structure, and closed-form solutions are extremely difficulty to obtain. Also, a realstic system model often has an unmanageably large state space and it quickly becomes impractical to even generate the entire transition rate matrix. In this paper, we present a methodology that can (i) bound the system steady state availability and at the same time, (ii) drastically reduce the state space of the model that must be solved. The bounding algorithm is iterative and generates a part of the transition matrix at each step. At each step, tighter bounds on system availability are obtained. The algorithm also allows the size of the submodel, to be solved at each step, to be chosen so as to accommodate memory limitations. This general bounding methodology provides an efficient way to evaluate dependability models with very large state spaces without ever generating the entire transition rate matrix."

Symbolwise method assign codes to individual symbols, while parsing methods assign codes to groups of consecutive symbols (phrases). The set of phrases available to a parsing method is referred to as a dictionary. The vast majority of parsing methods in the literature use greedy parsing (including nearly all variations of the popular Ziv-Lempel methods). When greedy parsing is used, the coder processes a string from left to right, at each step encoding as many symbols as possible with a phrase from the dictionary. This parsing strategy is not optimal, but an optimal method cannot guarantee a bounded coding delay. An important problem in compression research has been to establish the relationship between symbolwise methods and parsing methods. This paper extends prior work that shows that there are symbolwise methods that simulate a subset of greedy parsing methods. We provide a more general algorithm that takes any nonadaptive greedy parsing method and constructs a symbolwise method that achieves exactly the same compression.

Dynamic movement problems are of fundamental importance to robotics, but their computational complexity has not previously been investigated. We provide evidence that the 3-D dynamic movement problem is intractable even if B has only a constant number of degrees of freedom of movement. In particular, we prove the problem is PSPACE-hard if B is given a velocity modulus bound on its movements and is NP-hard even if B has no velocity modulus bound, where, in both cases, B has 6 degrees of freedom. To prove these results, we use a unique method of simulation of a Turing machine that uses time to encode configurations (whereas previous lower bound proofs in robotic motion planning used the system position to encode configurations and so required unbounded number of degrees of freedom). We also investigate a natural class of dynamic problems that we call asteroid avoidance problems: B, the object we wish to move, is a convex polyhedron that is free to move by translation with bounded velocity modulus, and the polyhedral obstacles have known translational trajectories but cannot rotate. This problem has many applications to robot, automobile, and aircraft collision avoidance. Our main positive results are polynomial time algorithms for the 2-D asteroid avoidance problem, where B is a moving polygon and we assume a constant number of obstacles, as well as single exponential time or polynomial space algorithms for the 3-D asteroid avoidance problem, where B is a convex polyhedron and there are arbitrarily many obstacles. Our techniques for solving these asteroid avoidance problems use ''normal path'' arguments, which are an interesting generalization of techniques previously used to solve static shortest path problems. We also give some additional positive results for various other dynamic movers problems, and in particular give polynomial time algorithms for the case in which B has no velocity bounds and the movements of obstacles are algebraic in space-time."

The previous best upper bound on the number of colors needed for coloring 3-colorable n-vertex graphs in polynomial time was O(square-root n/square-root log n) colors by Berger and Rompel, improving a bound of O(square-root n) colors by Wigderson.

Technically, the results are proved for cooperating pushdown automata with cooperating states, but they hold for appropriate versions of most concurrent models of computation.

Our procedures use a new representation for finite automata, based on the notion of equivalence between tests. We call the number of such equivalence classes the diversity of the automaton; the diversity may be as small as the logarithm of the number of states of the automaton. For the special class of permutation automata, we describe an inference procedure that runs in time polynomial in the diversity and log(1/delta), where delta is a given upper bound on the probability that our procedure returns an incorrect result. (Since our procedure uses randomization to perform experiments, there is a certain controllable chance that it will return an erroneous result.) We also discuss techniques for handling more general automata. We present evidence for the practical efficiency of our approach. For example, our procedure is able to infer the structure of an automaton based on Rubik's Cube (which has approximately 10(19) states) in about 2 minutes on a DEC MicroVax. This automaton is many orders of magnitude larger than possible with previous techniques, which would require time proportional at least to the number of global states. (Note that in this example, only a small fraction (10(-14)) of the global states were even visited.) Finally, we present a new procedure for inferring automata of a special type in which the global state is composed of a vector of binary local state variables, all of which are observable (or visible) to the experimenter. Our inference procedure runs provably in time polynomial in the size of this vector (which happens to be the diversity of the automaton), even though the global state space may be exponentially larger. The procedure plans and executes experiments on the unknown automaton; we show that the number of input symbols given to the automaton during this process is (to within a constant factor) the best possible."

Given a graph, how does one find the smallest (i.e., least number of edges) 2-connected spanning subgraph (connectivity refers to both edge and vertex connectivity, if not specified)? Unfortunately, the problem is known to be NP-hard. We consider the problem of finding a better approximation to the smallest 2-connected subgraph, by an efficient algorithm. For 2-edge connectivity, our algorithm guarantees a solution that is no more than 3/2 times the optimal. For 2-vertex connectivity, our algorithm guarantees a solution that is no more than 5/3 times the optimal. The previous best approximation factor is 2 for each of these problems. The new algorithms (and their analyses) depend upon a structure called a carving of a graph, which is of independent interest. We show that approximating the optimal Solution to within an additive constant is NP-hard as well. We also consider the case where the graph has edge weights. For this case, we show that an approximation factor of 2 is possible in polynomial time for finding a k-edge connected spanning subgraph. This improves an approximation factor of 3 for k = 2. due to Frederickson and JaJa [1981], and extends it for any k (with an increased running time though)."

We show how to construct an asymptotically optimal algorithm. We deduce that the time complexity is equal to: T(opt)(p) = n2/2p + p + o(n) for 1 less-than-or-equal-to p less-than-or-equal-to n/2 + square-root 2 + o(n) and that the minimum number of processors in order to compute the Givens factorization in asymptotically optimal time (2n + o(n)) is equal to p(opt) = n/(2 + square-root 2) + o(n). These results complete previous analysis presented in the case where the number of processors is unlimited.

Given the Fourier transform of f, direct computation of f by Fourier inversion requires on the order of Absolute value of G 2 operations. In this paper, using the techniques of induced representations, general results for more efficient computation of Fourier inversion are given. In combination with earlier results for fast computation of the Fourier transform [Diaconis and Rockmore, 1990] fast algorithms for computing group convolutions (or equivalently, multiplication in the group algebra) also are obtained. In a particular case of interest, when G is the symmetric group S(n), the methods are readily applied and careful analysis reduces (n!)2 to (n(n!))alpha/2 where alpha is the exponent of matrix multiplication (2.38 as of this writing). A similar bound is achieved for computing convolutions on S(n). To illustrate the techniques, the explicit constructions are carried out for S3. These ideas may be implemented in a straightforward manner on a computer. A practical algorithm is given for S(n)."

Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosystems to the learning problems.

In particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues.

The instance complexity of a string x with respect to a set A and time bound t, ic(t)(x : A), is defined as the size of the smallest special-case program for A that runs in time t, decides x correctly, and makes no mistakes on other strings (''don't know'' answers are permitted). We prove that a set A is in P if and only if there exist a polynomial t and a constant c such that ic(t)(x: A) less-than-or-equal-to c for all x; on the other hand, if A is NP-hard and P not-equal NP, then for all polynomials t and constants c, ic(t)(x:A) > c log Absolute value of x for infinitely many x. Observing that K(t)(x), the t-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of x, is roughly an upper bound on ic(t)(x: A), we proceed to investigate the existence of individually hard problem instances, i.e., strings whose instance complexity is close to their Kolmogorov complexity. We prove that if t(n) greater-than-or-equal-to n is a time-constructible function and A is a recursive set not in DTIME(t), there then exist a constant c and infinitely many x such that ic(t)(x:A) greater-than-or-equal-to K(t)(x) - c, for some time bound t'(n) dependent on the complexity of recognizing A.

It is assumed that the amount of (real) time between any two consecutive steps of any nonfaulty process is at least c1 and at most c2; thus, C = c2/c1 is a measure of the timing uncertainty. It is also assumed that the time for message delivery is at most d. Processes are assumed to fail by stopping, so that process failures can be detected by timeouts. A straightforward adaptation of an (f + 1)-round round-based agreement algorithm takes time (f + 1)Cd if there are f potential faults, while a straightforward modification of the proof that f + 1 rounds are required yields a lower bound of time (f + 1)d. The first result of this paper is an agreement algorithm in which the uncertainty factor C is only incurred for one round, yielding a running time of approximately 2 fd + Cd in the worst case. (It is assumed that c2 << d.) The second result shows that any agreement algorithm must take time at least (f - 1)d + Cd in the worst case. The new agreement algorithm can also be applied in a model where processors are synchronous (C = 1), and where message delay during a particular execution of the algorithm is bounded above by a quantity delta which could be smaller than the worst-case upper bound d.

The strategy depends on decomposing a planar graph into subgraphs of a form we call k-outerplanar. For fixed k, the problems of interest are solvable optimally in linear time on k-outerplanar graphs by dynamic programming. For general planar graphs, if the problem is a maximization problem, such as maximum independent set, this technique gives for each k a linear time algorithm that produces a solution whose size is at least k/(k + 1) optimal. If the problem is a minimization problem, such as minimum vertex cover, it gives for each k a linear time algorithm that produces a solution whose size is at most (k + 1)/k optimal. Taking k = inverted right perpendicular c log log n inverted left perpendicular or k = right perpendicular c log n left perpendicular, where n is the number of nodes and c is some constant, we get polynomial time approximation algorithms whose solution sizes converge toward optimal as n increases. The class of problems for which this approach provides approximation schemes includes maximum independent set, maximum tile salvage, partition into triangles, maximum H-matching, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, and minimum edge dominating set. For these and certain other problems, the proof of solvability on k-outerplanar graphs also enlarges the class of planar graphs for which the problems are known to be solvable in polynomial time."

Although the order of (natural) joins-here called the strategy for computing the joins-does not affect the final result, it docs determine to a large extent the response time of the query. Query optimizers therefore try to pick an optimal strategy. In practice, optimizers usually restrict their search for an optimal strategy to strategies that are linear (e.g.. of the form ((R1 times sign with bar connected to right and left of it R2) times sign with bar connected to right and left of it R3) times sign with bar connected to right and left of it R4), or that avoid Cartesian products, or both. The purpose of this paper is to examine the conditions under which an optimizer can find an optimal strategy, despite having restricted the scope of its search. Specifically, sufficient conditions are given under which (1) a linear strategy that is optimum will not use Cartesian products. (2) there is an optimum strategy that does not use Cartesian products, and (3) there is an optimum strategy that is linear and that does not use Cartesian products. (Optimality is with respect to the number of tuples generated by a strategy.) The necessity of these conditions is illustrated through examples. The conditions do not assume uniformity in the distribution of attribute values, nor independence in the attributes. Instead, they are either a formalization of heuristic assumptions, or based on semantic constraints. For example, the conditions are satisfied if all join attributes form superkeys. The analytic framework can be adapted for database acyclicity, lossless joins, unions, and intersections."

This work unifies notions of interval algebras in artificial intelligence with those of interval orders and interval graphs in combinatorics. The satisfiability, minimal labeling, all solutions, and all realizations problems are considered for temporal (internal) data. Several versions are investigated by restricting the possible interval relationships yielding different complexity results. We show that even when the temporal data comprises of subsets of relations based on intersection and precedence only, the satisfiability question is NP-complete. On the positive side, we give efficient algorithms for several restrictions of the problem. In the process, the interval graph sandwich problem is introduced, and is shown to be NP-complete.

By this generalization, we can find polynomial algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman problem on certain classes of graphs that are built from basic graphs by operations called r-sum, with r fixed.

Jobs are required to leave the system in their order of arrival. Therefore, after its sojourn time T in a queue a job also experiences a resequencing delay R, so that the time in system for a job is S = T + R. The distribution functions and the first moments of T, R, and S are first obtained by sample path arguments. The sojourn time T is shown to be convex in the load allocation vector in a strong stochastic sense defined in [21]. It is also shown that, in a homogeneous system, equal load allocation minimizes both the random variable T (in the usual stochastic order) and the system time S (in the increasing convex order). Attention is given to this optimum configuration in the rest of the paper. First, it is shown that T is stochastically decreasing and integer convex in K, and that S is decreasing in K. Then, asymptotic expressions for the distributions of T, R, and S are provided as K increases to infinity when the arrival rate to the system is held constant. These expressions show that the distributions of T, R, and S converge in 1/K to the corresponding distributions in the M/GI/infinity system with resequencing. They also provide asymptotic stochastic monotonicity and integer convexity results in K. Although the behavior of R, in general, depends on the load of the system, T and S always have similar structural characteristics, When the arrival rate grows linearly with K, a totally different limiting behavior emerges: Both ER and ES grow in log K, while ET remains constant."

A job consists of a set of tasks and a partial order specifying the precedence constraints between the tasks. The real-time constraints are specified by due times, also called soft real time deadlines. It is assumed that there is a predefined mapping from the set of tasks onto the set of machines that is identical for all jobs. Associated with each task is a service time that may depend on the machine that it is allocated to. The problem of scheduling tasks into execution at each machine is the subject of this paper. Dynamic nonpreemptive scheduling policies that do not use service-time information is examined and a class of Local Order Preserving (LOP) policies that contains the class of nonidling First Come First Serve (FCFS) policies is defined. It is shown that policies from this last class, along with the classes of LOP Shortest Due Time First (SDTF), LOP Largest Due Time First (LDTF), and LOP Last Come First Serve (LCFS) policies stochastically minimize the number of jobs in the system and maximize the job throughput. The class of FCFS policies is further shown to minimize the vector of transient response times in the increasing Schur convex sense. Last, we consider the job lateness, the difference between the due time and the completion time of the job, and prove that within the class of LOP policies, the SDTF and LDTF policies bound, respectively, from below and from above the transient vector of the job latenesses, in the Schur convex sense. The paper concludes with extensions to the steady state performance metrics, to the class of preemptive-resume policies, and to jobs having random task graphs. All of the results, except those concerned with preemptive policies, assume that task service times form mutually independent sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. In the latter case, service times are further assumed to be exponential random variables."

This problem is known to be equivalent to the problem of recognizing the existence of cycles in periodic (dynamic) graphs and to the validity of systems of recursive formulas. It was previously conjectured that combinatorial algorithms exist for the cases of two- and three-dimensional vector-weights. It is shown that strongly polynomial algorithms exist for any fixed dimension d. Moreover, these algorithms also establish membership in the class NC. On the other hand, it is shown that when the dimension of the weights is not fixed, the problem is equivalent to the general linear programming problem under strongly polynomial and logspace reductions. The algorithms presented here solve the cycle detection problem by reducing it to instances of the parametric minimum cycle problem. In the latter, graphs with edge-weights that are linear functions of d parameters are considered. The goal, roughly, is to find an assignment of the parameters such that the value of the minimum weight cycle is maximized. The technique we used in order to obtain strongly polynomial algorithms for the parametric minimum cycle problem is a general tool applicable to parametric extensions of a variety of other problems."

In this paper, a simple unified approximate analysis methodology to model the effect on system performance of data contention under different CC schemes and for different system structures is developed. This paper concentrates on modeling data contention and then, as others have done in other papers, the solutions of the data contention model are coupled with a standard hardware resource contention model through an iteration. The methodology goes beyond previously published methods for analyzing CC schemes in terms of the generality of CC schemes and system structures that are handled. The methodology is applied to analyze the performance of centralized transaction processing systems using various optimistic- and pessimistic-type CC schemes and for both fixed-length and variable-length transactions. The accuracy of the analysis is demonstrated by comparison with simulations.

These results are applicable to a wide class of nonmonotonic modal logics. Using these characterization results, algorithms for computing expansions for finite theories are developed. Perhaps the most important finding of this paper is that the structure of the family of modal nonmonotonic logics is much simpler than that of the family of underlying modal (monotonic) logics. Namely, it is often the case that different monotonic modal logics collapse to the same nonmonotonic system. We exhibit four families of logics whose nonmonotonic variants coincide: 5-KD45, TW5-SW5, N-WK, and W5-D4W5.

The unification type of E can thus be characterized by algebraic properties of S(E). The theory of Abelian groups with n commuting homomorphisms corresponds to the semiring Z[X1, ..., X(n)]. Thus, Hilbert's Basis Theorem can be used to show that this theory is unitary. But this argument does not yield a unification algorithm. Linear equations in Z[X1, ..., X(n)] can be solved with the help of Grobner Base methods, which thus provide the desired algorithm. The theory of Abelian monoids with a homomorphism is of type zero [4]. This can also be proved by using the fact that the corresponding semiring, namely N[X], is not Noetherian. Another example of a semiring (even ring) that is not Noetherian is the ring Z[X1, ..., X(n)], where X1, ..., X(n) (n > 1) are noncommuting indeterminates. This semiring corresponds to the theory of Abelian groups with n noncommuting homomorphisms.

Furthermore, one need not (and cannot) restrict attention to conjunctive normal form (CNF) when employing dissolution: A single application (even to a CNF formula) generally produces a non-CNF formula that is more compact than any of its CNF equivalents. Path dissolution is a global rule; as such, it is employed at the first order level diffeently from the way locally oriented techniques (such as resolution) are. Two methods for employing dissolution as an inference mechanism for first order logic are presented.

This method incorporates equality theory and a set of basic axioms of rings into inference rules based on linearization, identity paramodulation, and integer Gaussian elimination. Z-module reasoning proves a theorem by means of two distinct types of reasoning. One type of reasoning employs paramodulation-based deduction to deduce a set of identity vectors from a denial of the theorem. The other type of reasoning employs integer array manipulation to calculate the truth of the theorem in terms of the Z-module generated by these vectors. This paper is devoted to a formal description of Z-module reasoning, including motivation and background, formal definition, soundness and completeness theorems, the finite linearization property on standard polynomial sets, and the existence of a decisional Z-module reasoning prover for homogeneous equational sets.

The main result is that an AC0 Boolean function has almost all of its ''power spectrum'' on the low-order coefficients. An important ingredient of the proof is Hastad's switching lemma [8]. This result implies several new properties of functions in AC0: Functions in AC0 have low ''average sensitivity;'' they may be approximated well by a real polynomial of low degree and they cannot be pseudorandom function generators. Perhaps the most interesting application is an O(n(polylog(n)))-time algorithm for learning functions in AC0. The algorithm observes the behavior of an AC0 function on O(n(polylog(n))) randomly chosen inputs, and derives a good approximation for the Fourier transform of the function. This approximation allows the algorithm to predict, with high probability, the value of the function on other randomly chosen inputs."

A simple randomized strategy for maintaining dynamically evolving binary trees on hypercube networks is presented. The algorithm is distributed and does not require any global information. The algorithm guarantees that every pair of nodes adjacent in the tree are within distance O(log log N) in an N-processor hypercube. Furthermore, if M is the number of active nodes in the tree at any instant, then, with overwhelming probability, no hypercube processor is assigned more than O(1 + (M/N)) active nodes. The active nodes in a tree may constitute only leaves of the tree, or all nodes. As a corollary, with high probability, the load is evenly distributed throughout a computation whose running time is polynomial in N, the number of processors. The results can be generalized to bounded-degree trees. Our techniques justify the use of simple algorithms to efficiently parallelize any tree-based computation such as divide-and-conquer, backtrack, functional expression evaluation, and to efficiently maintain dynamic data structures such as quad-trees that arise in scientific applications. A novel technique-tree surgery-is introduced to deal with dependencies inherent in trees. Together with tree surgery, the study of random walks is used to analyze the algorithm."

The class of models considered simulates activity in a physical domain, and possesses a limited ability to predict future behavior. Using a stochastic model, it is shown that as the volume of simulation activity in the model increases relative to a fixed architecture, the complexity of the average per-event overhead due to synchronization, event list manipulation, lookahead calculations, and processor idle time approaches the complexity of the average per-event overhead of a serial simulation, sometimes rapidly. The method is therefore within a constant factor of optimal. The result holds for the worst case ''fully-connected'' communication topology, where an event in any portion of the domain can cause an event in any other portion of the domain. Our analysis demonstrates that on large problems-those for which parallel processing is ideally suited-there is often enough parallel workload so that processors are not usually idle. It also demonstrated the viability of the method empirically, showing how good performance is achieved on large problems using a thirty-two node Intel iPSC/2 distributed memory multiprocessor."

To avoid CPU hogging, job A receives (up to) a fixed amount of CPU time whenever it is served. When the time expires, job A immediately relinquishes the CPU and puts itself to sleep for a period of time. By doing so, jobs with low priority may be processed in a timely manner. When the sleep time is over, job A is awakened and waits to resume service according to its priority. Then, the whole process is repeated until job A service is completed. In this paper, such an execution/sleep (ES) scheduling policy is analyzed for serving job A in a nonpreemptive priority queuing system. The Laplace Transforms are derived for: (i) the conditional response time of job A and (ii) the response time for jobs with priorities higher and lower than job A. This work is motivated by the use of the ES policy in a switching system in which job A is invoked in response to the failure of signaling links. The proposed model is applicable to other real-time computer systems, and the modeling techniques can be applied or generalized to analyzing other scheduling policies in which timers are involved."

This paper describes a method for automatically extracting the necessary feature information and generating high-quality bitmaps without resorting to hand editing. Almost all of the work is done in a preprocessing step, the result of which is an intermediate form that can be quickly converted into bitmaps once the font size and device resolution are known. A heuristically defined system of linear equations describes how the ideal outlines should be distorted in order to produce the best possible results when scan converted in a straightforward manner. The Lovasz basis reduction algorithm then reduces the system of equations to a form that makes it easy to find an approximate solution subject to the constraint that some variables must be integers.

A general model for the processing of sequences of tasks is introduced, and a general on-line decision algorithm is developed. It is shown that, for an important class of special cases, this algorithm is optimal among all on-line algorithms. Specifically, a task system (S, d) for processing sequences of tasks consists of a set S of states and a cost matrix d where d(i, j) is the cost of changing from state i to state j (we assume that d satisfies the triangle inequality and all diagonal entries are 0). The cost of processing a given task depends on the state of the system. A schedule for a sequence T1, T2, ..., T(k) of tasks is a sequence s1, s2, ..., s(k) of states where si is the state in which T1 is processed; the cost of a schedule is the sum of all task processing costs and state transition costs incurred. An on-line scheduling algorithm is one that chooses s(i) only knowing T1T2 ... T(i). Such an algorithm is w-competitive if, on any input task sequence, its cost is within an additive constant of w times the optimal offline schedule cost. The competitive ratio w(S,d) is the infimum w for which there is a w-competitive on-line scheduling algorithm for (S, d). It is shown that w(S, d) = 2 Absolute value of S - 1 for every task system in which d is symmetric, and w(S, d) = O(Absolute value of S2) for every task system. Finally, randomized on-line scheduling algorithms are introduced. It is shown that for the uniform task system (in which d(i, j) = 1 for all i, j), the expected competitive ratio wBAR(S, d) O(log Absolute value of S)."

The transmission has to be on-line; i.e., a message cannot be accessed by the transmitting station before the preceding message has been received. Three resources are considered: The number of packets that have to be sent, the number of headers, and the amount of space required by the protocol. Three lower bounds are proved. First, the space required by any protocol for delivering n messages that uses less than n headers cannot be bounded by any function of n. Second, the number of packets that have to be sent by any protocol that uses a fixed number of headers in order to deliver a message is linear in the number of packets that are delayed on the channel at the time the message is sent. Finally, the notion of a probabilistic physical channel, in which a packet can be delayed on the channel with probability q, is introduced. An exponential lower bound, with overwhelming probability, is proved on the number of packets that have to be sent by any data-link protocol using a fixed number of headers when it is implemented over a probabilistic physical channel."

Several algorithms have been proposed to prevent such computations from seeing inconsistent states of the shared data. In this paper, two such orphan management algorithms are analyzed. The first is an algorithm implemented in the Argus distributed-computing system at MIT, and the second is an algorithm proposed at Carnegie-Mellon. The algorithms are described formally, and complete proofs of their correctness are given. The proofs show that the fundamental concepts underlying the two algorithms are very similar in that each can be regarded as an implementation of the same high-level algorithm. By exploiting properties of information flow within transaction management systems, the algorithms ensure that orphans only see states of the shared data that they could also see if they were not orphans.

Our main result is to give a simple characterization of a family of flow analyses where these issues can be ignored without compromising soundness.

The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book embedding. Separate book embedding algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces.

Task assignment in an heterogeneous multiple processors system is investigated. The cost function is formulated in order to measure the intertask communication and processing costs in an uncapacited network. A formulation of the problem in terms of the minimization of a submodular quadratic pseudo-Boolean function with assignment constraints is then presented. The use of a branch-and-bound algorithm using a Lagrangean relaxation of these constraints is proposed. The lower bound is the value of an approximate solution to the Lagrangean dual problem. A zero-duality gap, that is, a saddle point, is characterized by checking the consistency of a pseudo-Boolean equation. A solution is found for large-scale problems (e.g., 20 processors, 50 tasks, and 200 task communications or 10 processors, 100 tasks, and 300 task communications). Excellent experimental results were obtained which are due to the weak frequency of a duality gap and the efficient characterization of the zero-gap (for practical purposes, this is achieved in linear time).

Incompressibility is proved for the real numbers with a set of primitives that includes all functions that are continuous except on a countable closed set.

The data is usually just the values f(0), f(1), . . . . The scenario is modeled so that the learner is also allowed to ask questions about the data (e.g., (for-all x) [x > 17 double-line arrow pointing right f(x) = 0]?). An important parameter is the language that the learner may use to formulate queries. We show that for most languages a learner can learn more by asking questions than by passively receiving data.

Two models of systems are considered. Systems in the first model consist of a unique control process and an arbitrary number of user processes with identical definitions. For this model, a decision procedure to check whether all the executions of a process satisfy a given specification is presented. This algorithm runs in time double exponential in the sizes of the control and the user process definitions. It is also proven that it is decidable whether all the fair executions of a process satisfy a given specification. The second model is a special case of the first. In this model, all the processes have identical definitions. For this model, an efficient decision procedure is presented that checks if every execution of a process satisfies a given temporal logic specification.

The algorithm presented in this paper processes images in predetermined order, which means that the processing order depends only on the image representation scheme and not on specific properties of the image. The algorithm handles a wide variety of image representation schemes (rasters, run lengths, quadtrees, bintrees, etc.). How to adapt the standard UNION-FIND algorithm to permit reuse of temporary labels is shown. This is done using a technique called age balancing, in which, when two labels are merged, the older label becomes the father of the younger label. This technique can be made to coexist with the more conventional rule of weight balancing, in which the label with more descendants becomes the father of the label with fewer descendants. Various image scanning orders are examined and classified. It is also shown that when the algorithm is specialized to a pixel array scanned in raster order, the total processing time is linear in the number of pixels. The linear-time processing time follows from a special property of the UNION-FIND algorithm, which may be of independent interest. This property states that under certain restrictions on the input, UNION-FIND runs in time linear in the number of FIND and UNION operations. Under these restrictions, linear-time performance can be achieved without resorting to the more complicated Gabow-Tarjan algorithm for disjoint set union."

The concept of institution is introduced to formalize the informal notion of \logical system.\"" The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure \""in-the-large\""; for example, we can define language features for building large structures from smaller ones, possibly involving parameters, without commitment to any particular logical system. This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artificial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third main result gives conditions under which it is sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another. A fourth main result shows how to extend institutions so that their theories may include, in addition to the original sentences, various kinds of constraint that are. useful for defining abstract data types, including both \""data\"" and \""hierarchy\"" constraints.

Often, the number of customer classes and their associated device demands are unknown or are unmeasurable parameters of the system. However, when the system is viewed as having a single composite customer class, the aggregate single-class parameters are more easily obtainable. This paper addresses the error made when constructing a single-class model of a multi-class system. It is shown that the single-class model pessimistically bounds the performance of the multi-class system. Thus, given a multi-class system, the corresponding single-class model can be constructed with the assurance that the actual system performance is better than that given by the single-class model. In the worst case, it is shown that the throughput given by the single-class model underestimates the actual multi-class throughput by, at most. 50%. Also, lower bounds are provided for the number of necessary customer classes, given observed device utilizations. This information is useful to clustering analysis techniques as well as to analysts who must obtain class-specific device demands."

However, until now, there have been no results establishing whether a given lowness result is the best possible. We prove absolute lower bounds on the location of classes in the extended low hierarchy and relativized lower bounds on the location of classes in the low hierarchy in NP. In some cases, we are able to show that the classes are lower in the hierarchies than was known previously. In almost all cases, we are able to prove that our results are essentially optimal. We also examine the interrelationships among the levels of the low hierarchies and the classes of sets reducible to or equivalent to sparse and tally sets under different notions of reducibility. We feel that these results clarify the structure underlying the low hierarchies."
